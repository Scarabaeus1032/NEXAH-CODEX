# 📐 NEXA_42_MOBIUS_ALIGNMENT – Core Equations

This document collects and summarizes the key equations used in the 42-tone Möbius harmonic resonance model.

---

## 1. Frequency Equation (42-Tone Scale)

The foundation of the system is a logarithmic scale dividing the octave into 42 equal steps:

\[
f_n = f_0 \cdot 2^{\frac{n}{42}}
\]

- \( f_0 \): base frequency, typically set at 432 Hz
- \( n \): step index, where \( n \in \mathbb{Z} \)

---

## 2. Planck Energy Coupling

Every frequency corresponds to a quantized energy level:

\[
E_n = h \cdot f_n
\]

- \( h \): Planck constant  
- \( f_n \): frequency from the 42-tone formula

---

## 3. Möbius Phase Rotation per Tone

Each tone is associated with a rotation angle on the Möbius structure:

\[
\theta_n = \frac{360^\circ}{42} \cdot n
\]

- 42 steps form a complete rotation loop
- Can be interpreted as harmonic phase angles

---

## 4. Prime Number Resonance Formula

Stable resonance nodes occur at prime positions based on:

\[
P_k = 6k \pm 1
\]

- Prime-based structure aligns with natural harmonic reinforcements
- \( k \in \mathbb{N} \)

---

## 5. Combined Harmonic Field Equation

To synthesize tone, energy, and phase, a resonance field model is proposed:

\[
R_{n,p} = h \cdot f_0 \cdot 2^{\frac{n}{42}} \cdot \sin(\theta_p), \quad p \in \mathbb{P}
\]

Where:

- \( R_{n,p} \): resonance at tone step \( n \) and prime anchor \( p \)
- \( \theta_p = \frac{360^\circ}{42} \cdot p \)
- \( \mathbb{P} \): set of primes fitting the resonance grid
