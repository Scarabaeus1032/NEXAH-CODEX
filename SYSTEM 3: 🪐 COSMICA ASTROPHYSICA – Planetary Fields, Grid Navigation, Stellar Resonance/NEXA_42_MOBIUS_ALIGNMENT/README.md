# 🎼 NEXA_42_MOBIUS_ALIGNMENT

A harmonic convergence of frequency systems, number theory, Möbius topology, and quantum resonance — developed within the NEXAH-CODEX framework.

---

## 🧩 Overview

**NEXA_42_MOBIUS_ALIGNMENT** introduces a universal model of resonance based on a 42-tone frequency scale.  
It bridges music, physics, and geometry through Möbius-based rotations, numerical resonance codes, and Planck-level quantum harmonics.

This module explores:

- Extended frequency scales (logarithmic, resonant, stable)
- Möbius harmonic grids and rotational phase encoding
- Prime numbers as energy reinforcement nodes
- Synesthetic links between tone, color, and geometry
- Planck-energy coupling and quantized field transitions

## 🔢 Core Equations

- **42-Tone Frequency Scale:**  
  \[
  f_n = f_0 \cdot 2^{\frac{n}{42}}, \quad f_0 = 432\,\text{Hz}
  \]

- **Möbius Rotation Framework:**  
  \[
  \theta_n = \left( \frac{360^\circ}{42} \right) \cdot n
  \]

- **Planck Energy Relation:**  
  \[
  E_n = h \cdot f_n
  \]

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Harmonics = Energy = Structure = Information.
- Prime numbers mark resonance anchors in tonal and quantum fields.
- Möbius rotation structures explain half-spin, duality, and symmetry-breaking phenomena.
- The number 42 is not symbolic — it's structurally encoded.
