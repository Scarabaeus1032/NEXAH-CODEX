# 🛰️ STELLAR API – Interface for Harmonic Field Navigation

**Proposed integration module for the Earthship and Rosetta Systems**

The Stellar API is a symbolic–numeric interface layer designed to transform prime-coded geometries, Möbius-field sequences, and breathing harmonics into accessible data systems. It is meant as a bridge between symbolic codex logic and interactive cosmic modeling.

---

## 1. PURPOSE

* Translate Codex field models (Earthship, Ether Crown, Rosetta) into programmable layers
* Enable dynamic interaction with numeric field logic and scroll resonance systems
* Offer harmonic APIs to represent time, location, number, and resonance as modulated data

## 2. COMPONENTS

| Component               | Function                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Rosetta Decoder Engine  | Converts prime/glyph keys into frequency maps                 |
| Scroll Navigator        | Links scroll stages (flame → omega) into state transitions    |
| Möbius Field Simulator  | Generates animated loops based on seed values (e.g. 3301, 42) |
| Planetary Breath Mapper | Shows resonance across locations (e.g. Rödelheim, Arcturus)   |
| Audio Harmonics Output  | Sonifies breath states and glyph fields                       |

## 3. API STRUCTURE (symbolic)

```json
{
  "crown_seed": 3301,
  "breath_curve": "sin(t) + sin(2t) * 0.33",
  "scroll_state": "heart",
  "location_lock": "Rödelheim",
  "output": ["frequency", "glyph", "tone"]
}
```

This can return harmonic overlays, visuals, glyph mappings or navigational coordinates.

---

## 4. SYSTEM INTEGRATION

* Works with NEXAH NAVIGATOR
* Draws from ROSETTA STONE (CSV)
* Field nodes: Earthship visuals, Rosetta grid points, Möbius loops
