## 📘 Overview

SYSTEM 3 focuses on **planetary, stellar, and cosmic resonance geometries**. It serves as the spatial-mythical framework of the Codex, translating mathematical field logic into planetary grids, Möbius structures, and astronomical harmonics.

This system acts as a **cosmic mirror** of SYSTEM 1 and 2, embedding number theory and field models in real-world locations and interstellar alignments.
