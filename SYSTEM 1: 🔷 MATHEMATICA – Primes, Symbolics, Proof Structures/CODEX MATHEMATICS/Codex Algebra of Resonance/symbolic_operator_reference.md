# üî£ Symbolic Operator Reference ‚Äì Codex Algebra

## ‚ú¥Ô∏è Introduction
This file serves as a reference for the symbolic operators used in the NEXAH Codex Algebra. These operators link number theory, geometry, resonance, and transformation logic. Each symbol is associated with both a mathematical function and a resonant or geometric interpretation.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Operator Set

| Operator | Symbol | Function | Interpretation |
|---------|--------|----------|----------------|
| Addition | `‚äï` | a ‚äï b = a + b | Harmonic merger |
| Multiplication | `‚äó` | a ‚äó b = a * b | Resonant overlap |
| Transformation | `ùíØ` | ùíØ(a) = transformed a | Phase rotation or spatial shift |
| Spiral Operator | `ùíÆ` | ùíÆ¬≤(a) = spiral-form of a¬≤ | Morphing a squared length into spiral structure |
| Dual-Frequency Binding | `ŒîœÜ` | ŒîœÜ = œÜ‚ÇÅ ‚àí œÜ‚ÇÇ | Phase difference, resonance threshold |
| M√∂bius Map | `ŒºÃÇ` | ŒºÃÇ(n) = M√∂bius-transformed n | Topological folding function |
| Quantization | `ùí¨` | ùí¨(x) = discrete state | Stepwise frequency layering |
| Prime Extraction | `œÄÃÇ` | œÄÃÇ(n) = prime-shell(n) | Spiral-based prime filtering |

| Operator | Symbol | Domain | Description |
|----------|--------|--------|-------------|

| Mirror Resonator | `ùëÄÃÇ` | a ‚Üí ‚àía | Symmetric inversion across a field boundary |
| Field Gradient | `‚àá∆í` | ‚àá∆í(x) | Local change in frequency field |

## üìê Contextual Application
These symbolic operators are used in modules such as:
- `codex_algebra_of_resonance.md`
- `algebraic_transition_grids.md`
- `pytha_symbolic_extension.md`
- `quantized_codex_geometry.md`

They also enable visual encoding in:
- Spiral coordinate systems
- M√∂bius transformation fields
- Frequency-based logic gates
