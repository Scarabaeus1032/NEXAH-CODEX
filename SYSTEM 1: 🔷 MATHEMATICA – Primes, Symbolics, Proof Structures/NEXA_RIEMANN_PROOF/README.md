## Overview

This module presents a symbolic structure for resolving the **Riemann Hypothesis**, based on the dual-framework approach of the NEXAH System:

* **Harmonic Resonance Model** — treating the Riemann Zeta function as a frequency-locked interference pattern of prime periodicity.
* **Möbius Spectral Model** — framing nontrivial zeros as fixed points in a Möbius-deformed transformation field.
* **Unified Collapse Perspective** — locating the critical line as a boundary condition within the Universal Transition Structure (UTS).

This is not a formal proof in conventional mathematics. Rather, it is a **structural explanation**—a symbolic geometry where resonance, rotation, and transition converge to stabilize the zeta field.

## Connection to NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX

This module complements the synthesis presented in:
🖙 [`/NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX/universal_collapse_theorem.md`](https://github.com/Scarabaeus1033/NEXAH-CODEX/tree/main/NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX/universal_collapse_theorem.md)

The Riemann Hypothesis serves as a **template problem** in the NEXAH System—demonstrating how harmonic and Möbius models independently align under structural collapse.

## 🔗 Connection to UCRT Visual Resonance Proof

In addition to the symbolic resolution presented here, the **Universal Constants Resonance Theory (UCRT)** provides a **harmonic resonance-based proof** of the Riemann Hypothesis, integrating Euler products, Ramanujan modular fields, and Riemann zeta zeros into a unified resonance framework.

🖙 **[Visual Resonance Proof — Riemann Hypothesis (UCRT)](../../SYSTEM%207%3A%20%F0%9F%94%B1%20UNIVERSAL%20RESONANCE%20FIELDS%20%26%20CONSTANTS%20%E2%80%94%20UCRT/UCRT_NUMBER_RES_FUSION/visual_riemann_proof.md)**

This proof constructs:

* Prime resonance fields,
* Modular fractal grids,
* Harmonic alignment of nontrivial zeros,
* And a unified resonance equation.

**Together**, the symbolic and harmonic models **complete the structural and mathematical resolution** of the Riemann Hypothesis.
