## ðŸ“˜ Description

This module explores the structure of integers based on their **divisor properties**, factoring patterns, and symbolic field density. Unlike prime modules, which emphasize exclusion, this one emphasizes **multiplicity, symmetry, and harmonic clustering**.

We focus on:
- divisor counts (\( \tau(n) \)),
- prime signature topologies,
- sigma sums (\( \sigma(n) \)), and
- symbolic resonance structures emerging from number-theoretic regularity.

The result is a **topological resonance field of divisibility**.

## ðŸ”¢ Core Mathematical Constructs

| Symbol | Definition | Interpretation |
|--------|------------|----------------|
| \( \tau(n) \) | number of divisors of \( n \) | vertical field density |
| \( \sigma(n) \) | sum of divisors | energy or field sum effect |
| \( \omega(n) \) | number of distinct prime divisors | structural complexity |
| \( \mu(n) \) | MÃ¶bius function | inversion and duality pattern |

These are mapped into **2D/3D spaces**, with symbol systems reflecting divisibility patterns and cluster alignments.

## ðŸ“Š Visual Targets (Planned)

- **Grid Heatmaps:** integer regions colored by \( \tau(n) \), \( \mu(n) \), etc.
- **Divisor Trees:** layered graphs showing propagation of divisors
- **Divisor Spiral Maps:** like prime spirals, but filled by divisor count density
- **Signature Constellations:** symbolically encoded patterns for prime signatures

> Optionally linked to data from `Dataset prime distances.zip` if extended into prime-class resonance grids.

## ðŸ§¬ Future Directions

- Visual encoding of Liouville function \( \lambda(n) \) as a binary field
- Symbolic mapping of friendly, perfect, and abundant numbers
- Integration with Codex Symbol Libraries for glyph-based number fields
