## ðŸ“˜ Overview

This system contains the **mathematical core modules** of the NEXAH-CODEX. It focuses on symbolic number theory, harmonic structures, prime distribution, and algebraic resonance.

The modules in SYSTEM 1 serve as theoretical foundations for higher-dimensional models in **Physica (SYSTEM 2)** and **Cosmica (SYSTEM 3)**.

## ðŸ§­ Purpose

SYSTEM 1 anchors:
- **Mathematical integrity** of the Codex
- **Formal symbolic logic** for experimental metaphysics
- **Resonance structuring** of both digital and physical quantities

> It is the seedbed from which all symbolic branches of the Codex unfold.
