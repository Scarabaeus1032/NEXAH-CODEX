## 📘 Description

`PRIME-GRID-VISUALS` explores spatially interpreted number theory – particularly the grid-based visualization of prime numbers, their distances, modular relations, and irregularities. It transforms discrete sequences into geometric insight.

The module supports SYSTEM 1 (Mathematica) and connects to SYSTEM X (GRAND-CODEX) through prime-tensor resonances and modular symmetry axes.

## 🎨 Visual Examples (planned for `/prime-grid-visuals/`)

- Prime gaps as colored heatmap grids
- Radial prime plots with distance weighting
- Modulo-6 and modulo-12 symmetry fields
- Phi-resonant prime lattices
- Shadow maps: non-prime densities

---

## 🧠 Mathematical Themes

### 1. Prime Gaps and Clustering
Highlighting irregular sequences and resonant islands, especially:
- Twin primes (Δ=2)
- Prime deserts (Δ>10)
- Distribution along spiral projection

### 2. Modulo Logic and Residual Symmetries
Visual maps for:
```math
p \mod n
```
with common n = 6, 8, 12, 30
→ reveals lattice breaks and recurring voids

### 3. Fractal and Grid Structures
Prime placement in:
- Pascal-style triangle arrays
- Fractal row/column modulators
- Symmetric rings

## 📐 Key Equations

**Prime difference:**
```math
\Delta_n = p_{n+1} - p_n
```
Plotted as vertical bars over n (prime index)

**Modulo placement (colored):**
```math
C(p) = \text{color}[p \mod m]
```

**Density map:**
```math
D(x) = \frac{1}{\Delta_x}
```
(High = clustering, Low = gaps)
