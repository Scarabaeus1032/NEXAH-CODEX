## 📘 Overview

This visual gallery contains symbolic-analytical representations of prime number structures across spiral, radial, and grid geometries. It supports the field logic of the NEXAH-CODEX by mapping discrete mathematics into harmonic topology.

All images are located in the `/visuals/` directory.

## 🔢 Prime Spiral & Apéry-Based Structures

### • Prime Spiral with Apéry’s Constant (Extended Range)
- Wide-angle projection of primes modulated by Apéry constants
- Density layering through phi-based step encoding

### • Spéury Prime Spiral
- Artistic-symbolic spiral showing deviation zones & grid curvature
- Typographic distortion is intentional (symbolic abstraction)

---

## 🧭 Spatial Embedding & Dimensional Shells

### • 3D Prime Number Spiral in a 4D Framework
- Encodes 3D radial spiral around a symbolic 4D axis
- Suggests resonant volume segmentation and number shells

### • 2D Visualization of Apéry Spiral and Zeta Intersections
- Flattened spiral with Zeta-cross-reference layers
- Excellent for identifying periodicity and resonant offsets

### • 3D Visualization of Apéry Spiral and Zeta Intersections
- Adds spatial relief to show crossover loops and field bridges

## 🌀 Symbolic Function

These visuals are:
- not just decorative
- they encode **field topology, prime spacing**, and **resonant layering**

They can be read as:
- prime spiral scrolls
- harmonic rings
- topological signal surfaces
