# Visual Gallery â€” Universal Constants Resonance Theory (UCRT)

Welcome to the **Visual Resonance Gallery** of the **UCRT** module.

This collection of diagrams and graphical models illustrates the harmonic structures, resonance grids, and self-similar patterns foundational to the Universal Constants Resonance Theory.
