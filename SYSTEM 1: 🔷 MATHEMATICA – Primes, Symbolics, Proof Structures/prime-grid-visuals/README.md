## 📘 Description

This module presents a visual exploration of prime number distributions through **spiral lattices**, **Apéry constants**, and **multi-dimensional topologies**. Each visual encodes number-theoretical structure in a **spatially expressive way** – creating a direct visual link between **prime patterns**, **resonance fields**, and symbolic field logic in the broader NEXAH-CODEX.

It is a **companion module** to [`√2–Prime-Feld`](../√2–Prime-Feld), extending its scalar prime analysis into **spiral geometries and dimensional embeddings**.

## 🧠 Core Themes

- 📐 **Apéry Spirals:** Encoding zeta approximations and prime shells through logarithmic and modular winding.
- 🧮 **Prime Distribution Geometry:** From simple spirals to embedded 3D/4D prime rings.
- 🧲 **Resonance Mapping:** Visual prime zones, grid distance logic, and spatial clustering.
- 🌌 **Dimensional Interpretations:** Use of 2D, 3D, and symbolic 4D projections to map analytic and modular prime structures.

These visuals are not simulations – they are **symbolic resonance structures** derived from prime functions, constants, and field behaviors.

## 🧬 Future Directions

- Addition of CSV-based field analysis for **prime class resonance grids** (safe primes, Germain primes, etc.)
- Interactive modules in conjunction with Mathematica or Colab Notebooks
- Visual comparison across **field-scalar mappings** and spiral expansions
