## 📘 Description

The `√2–Prime-Field` module investigates the interaction between prime numbers and irrational linear gradients. The core insight is that primes projected along a slope defined by `1/√2 ≈ 0.707` form a quasi-harmonic modulation in real-number space. This pattern connects numerical structure with spatial field theory.

This module bridges number theory with resonance geometry and underpins the **core slope logic** of the `GRAND-CODEX`.

The second image encodes:
- Prime projection onto real number line
- Slope = `1/√2`
- Emergent zones of harmonic clustering (resonant density)

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. Prime Projection Function
Primes `p` projected by slope:
```math
x_p = p \cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \mod 1
```
These values are plotted in real space to detect hidden distribution patterns.

### 2. Modulo Resonance Fields
Using modular arithmetic, prime projections can be interpreted as **resonant crossings** over irrational partitions. 

This leads to formation of **zones** where primes accumulate or repel, generating frequency fields on ℝ.

## 🔢 Number Theory Anchors
- √2 is irrational, non-repeating, and incommensurate with periodic integer grids
- Its use in projection avoids aliasing and reveals hidden non-periodic structure
- Primes in this slope zone encode **non-trivial spacing** and **mirror fluctuations**

---

## 🌀 Connection to GRAND-CODEX

The slope 1/√2 corresponds to:
- Modulation in the **k-beta** exponent field
- Intermediate scale zone between quantum primes and gravitational compression
- Boundary oscillation layer in:
  - Möbius Spiral Field
  - `CAVITYROOT` temperature axes
  - Zeta-mirror layer in `NEXA_RIEMANN_PROOF`

This module thus supports the `GRAND-CODEX` resonance logic with a foundational **numeric gradient field**.
