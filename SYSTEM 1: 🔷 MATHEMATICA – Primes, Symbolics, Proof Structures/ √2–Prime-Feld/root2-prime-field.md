## 📘 Module Overview

This module explores the harmonic and irregular interaction between **prime number sequences** and the irrational constant **√2**. The focus is on building a geometric and symbolic field structure, where prime order and irrationality produce new resonance axes, semi-chaotic behaviors, and grid topologies.

Rooted in Codex logic, this module extends the spiral-grid prime theories and connects to symbolic constants used across the Möbius, NEXA, and URF systems.

## 🔢 Core Concepts

### 1. **Root-2 Modulation of Prime Sequences**

* By multiplying or mapping primes over √2, patterns emerge that are **non-periodic**, but **predictively bound**.
* This leads to beat-like effects in number-line spacing.
* Visualization: *dual spiral projection* over φ and √2.

### 2. **Aubéry Constant** (α ≈ 1.245...)

* Interpreted here as a *resonance modulator*, filtering non-prime frequency gaps.
* Connection to **quasiperiodic tiling** and **Zeta function irregularities**.

### 3. **Dimensional Shift via Root-2**

* √2 is treated as an **inter-axis gateway**, marking boundary conditions for rotational symmetry.
* Link to Möbius-splits and time-phase jumps in Codex wave models.

## 📐 Equational Framework

We introduce:

```math
P(√2) = p_n · √2 mod φ
```

Where:

* `p_n` is the nth prime
* `φ` is the golden ratio (≈1.618)

This generates a normalized irrational overlay of the prime structure onto circular or radial fields.

A second resonance transformation:

```math
R(n) = |√2 · p_n − round(√2 · p_n)|
```

Interpreted as **modulation residue**, revealing prime-resonant harmonics.

## 🌀 Symbolic & Visual Topologies

* Spiral overlay of √2 and φ-based fields
* Prime-progression mapped against irrational radius expansion
* Mirror symmetries appearing via √2-phase offset
* Dual-layered lattices revealing prime non-alignment zones
