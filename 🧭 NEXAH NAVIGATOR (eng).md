🧭 NEXAH NAVIGATOR – Structural Overview & Reading Guide

The NEXAH-CODEX is a modular archive for harmonic field theory, frequency geometry, symbolic physics, and numerical-cosmological resonance structures. This document serves as a navigator through all current modules – grouped by theme, codex family, and reading depth.

⸻

🌌 INTRO – What is the Codex?

The Codex is not a book – it is a resonant field. Each module is a standalone domain: visual, mathematical, symbolic, physical. Together they form a universal system of harmonic order. The aim is to connect number, form, place, time, language, matter, and consciousness.

🔗 Notes
	•	Visuals for most modules are located in the visuals/ directory
	•	Mathematical layer is fully under GRAND-CODEX/codex-mathematics/
	•	Main documentation: README.md, roadmap.md, manifest.md
	•	All modules can be read independently, but are often interlinked by numbers, symbols or locations

“The Codex is not a book. It is a field. And each module is a gate.”
