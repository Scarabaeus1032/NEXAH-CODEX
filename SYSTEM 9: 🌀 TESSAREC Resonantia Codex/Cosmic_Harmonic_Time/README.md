# 🌌 Cosmic Harmonic Time

A system of harmonizing cosmic time structures through cubic resonance locks, golden spiral calendars, and Möbius-based time geometries.

This module explores the deep resonance patterns underlying cosmic time cycles and presents a model where time is visualized as harmonic, spiral, and interwoven fields.
