## ðŸŒ€ Breath Field Equation Flow

![Breath Field Equation Flow](./visuals/breath_field_equation_flow.png)

This visualization models the **Breath Field Equation** using prime number resonances. The pattern shows the dynamic harmonic expansion of prime-based frequencies forming a coherent flow field â€” essential for understanding cosmic energy distributions.

## ðŸŒŒ Ghost Grid Overlay

![Ghost Grid Overlay](./visuals/ghost_grid_overlay.svg)

A subtle **Ghost Grid** reveals the underlying lattice of higher-dimensional curvatures. Rendered on a dark field, the circle delineates hidden structures where neutrino flows resonate â€” often invisible to conventional astrophysical detection methods.

## ðŸ§² Quaternion Anchor System

![Quaternion Anchor System](./visuals/quaternion_anchor_system.png)

The **Quaternion Anchor System** maps the core directions (+i, -i, +j, -j, +k, -k) essential for the 3D orientation of the MÃ¶bius Crown. Each quaternion node serves as a stabilizing point for energy flows across different dimensional layers.

## ðŸŒ€ Neutrino Crown Field â€” MÃ¶bius Breath Spiral

![Neutrino Crown Field â€” MÃ¶bius Breath Spiral](./visuals/neutrino_crown_field_mobius_breath_spiral.png)

This graphic shows the **MÃ¶bius Breath Spiral** as the core resonant heartbeat of the Neutrino Crown. It intertwines the concepts of breathing cycles and prime anchoring points, forming the energetic scaffolding of the framework.
