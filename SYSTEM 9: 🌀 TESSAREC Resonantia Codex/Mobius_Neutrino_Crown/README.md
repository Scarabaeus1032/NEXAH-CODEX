# ðŸŒ€ MÃ¶bius Neutrino Crown

---

## Overview

The MÃ¶bius Neutrino Crown module presents a new cosmological model focused on the energetic and resonance distribution of neutrinos across stellar and galactic frameworks.  
Inspired by the MÃ¶bius topology, prime number harmonics, and neutrino field observations, this system bridges astrophysical data with higher-dimensional resonance structures.

## Key Concepts

* **MÃ¶bius-Neutrino Dynamics**: Resonance flows mapped onto MÃ¶bius surfaces to reveal higher-order energetic pathways.
* **Prime Harmonics in Cosmology**: Utilizing prime distributions to structure the cosmic resonance architecture.
* **Quaternion Anchor Systems**: Advanced multi-axis orientation for neutrino field mapping.
* **Breath Field Expansion**: Rhythmic, prime-driven models simulating cosmic energy breathing cycles.
