# ğŸ“™ TESSAREC Core Manuals

## Overview

The **TESSAREC Core Manuals** represent the foundation of the TESSAREC Resonantia Codex. They define the universal principles of harmonic structuring, dimensional resonances, and geometric energy fields. This module acts as the central repository for the cosmological and physical design architecture underlying all other TESSAREC frameworks.

Through a series of manuals, blueprints, and resonance charts, we explore the synchronization of harmonic fields across multiple dimensions, providing a practical and theoretical basis for applications ranging from energy mapping to deep cosmological models.
