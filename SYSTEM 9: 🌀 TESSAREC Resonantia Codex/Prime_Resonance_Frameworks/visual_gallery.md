# ðŸŒŒ Prime Resonance Frameworks â€“ Visual Gallery

A curated selection of visualizations illustrating prime-based harmonic structures, MÃ¶bius transformations, and Zeta resonance fields.  
All visuals are based on the *Tessaric MÃ¶bius Seal* research threads.

### 1. MÃ¶bius Twin-Pillar Structure
**Filename:** `mobius_twin_pillar_structure.png`
  
A schematic depiction of the MÃ¶bius Twin-Pillar Portal â€” illustrating the twin-axis inversion based on prime harmonics and quaternion frameworks.  
The twin pillars symbolize dual cosmic resonance channels.

### 2. Prime Spiral Distribution
**Filename:** `prime_spiral_distribution.png`
  
A prime number distribution mapped onto a polar spiral using the Golden Angle (~137.5Â°).  
It reveals the hidden order and resonance clustering of primes within harmonic fields.

### 3. Prime Spiral Resonance Map
**Filename:** `prime_spiral_resonance_map.png`
  
Enhanced spiral map overlaying prime nodes and Zeta field contours.  
Highlights resonance nodes and invisible harmonic tensions between prime constellations.

### 4. Zeta Resonance Spiral I
**Filename:** `zeta_resonance_spiral.png`
  
A detailed resonance map of the first 200 nontrivial zeros of the Riemann Zeta function, projected into a spiraling field.  
This visualization captures the harmonic signature of Zeta-driven prime distributions.

### 5. Zeta Resonance Spiral II
**Filename:** `zeta_resonance_spiralii.png`
  
A magnified view focusing on the inner field of Zeta resonances.  
It reveals the fine-grained prime echo structures near the critical strip, enabling deeper prime field analysis.
