# 📘 Tessaric Möbius Seal — Prime Resonance Frameworks

The **Tessaric Möbius Seal** is a deep exploration into prime number structures, harmonic fields, and Möbius-based resonance geometries.  
This module systematically investigates the mathematical and symbolic resonance patterns of prime distributions, connecting them with physical, biological, and geometric phenomena.

## 🌀 About the Prime Resonance Framework

This project unites the elegance of prime number theory with harmonic and geometric interpretations.  
It proposes that **prime numbers** are not just randomly distributed but are **embedded in deeper harmonic fields** that connect number theory with the fabric of reality.

Tessaric Möbius Seal opens a gateway to:
- Higher-dimensional geometries
- Harmonic time-frequency analysis
- Symbolic-mathematical languages
- Universal resonance structures
