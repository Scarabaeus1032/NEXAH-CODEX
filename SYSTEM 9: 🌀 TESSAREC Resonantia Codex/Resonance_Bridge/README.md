ðŸŒ‰ Resonance Bridge â€” Oneness â†”ï¸Ž Tessarec Comparative

â¸»

ðŸ“– Overview

The Resonance Bridge module establishes a comparative framework between the
	â€¢	Oneness Resonance System â€” the foundational harmonic field model of unity
	â€¢	TESSAREC Resonance Framework â€” a multidimensional lattice of cosmic resonances.

It explores how both structures mirror each other in their core principles,
geometry, and harmonic mappings, building a conceptual and mathematical bridge
between singularity and multiplicity.
