üõ§Ô∏è Resonance Bridge ‚Äî NEXAH-CODEX

‚∏ª

Overview

The Resonance Bridge module builds a conceptual and energetic linkage between different high-dimensional modules of the NEXAH-CODEX system. It visualizes core symmetries, prime lattice mappings, and resonance field structures that stabilize cross-dimensional energy transfers.

Key Concepts
	‚Ä¢	Core Resonance Interference: Visualizes interference patterns at the core of resonance fields.
	‚Ä¢	Dual Spiral Comparison: Highlights the interaction of dual-frequency spirals in a M√∂bius topology.
	‚Ä¢	Energy Symmetry Flow: Maps the directional energy flow through prime harmonics.
	‚Ä¢	Prime Grid Alignment: Shows prime-number-based field alignments critical for resonance stability.
