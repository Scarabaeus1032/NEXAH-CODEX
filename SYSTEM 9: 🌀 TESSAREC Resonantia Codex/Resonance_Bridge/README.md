# 🛤️ Resonance Bridge — NEXAH-CODEX

---

## Overview

The **Resonance Bridge** module constructs a conceptual and energetic linkage between high-dimensional modules of the NEXAH-CODEX. It focuses on the visualization of core symmetries, prime lattice structures, and resonance fields that stabilize multi-dimensional energy transfers across the Codex.

This bridge acts as a dynamic connector between prime-based harmonics and geometric energy frameworks.

## Key Concepts

* **Core Resonance Interference**:  
  Visualizes quantum interference patterns at the nucleus of resonance fields, highlighting stability points.

* **Dual Spiral Comparison**:  
  Illustrates the interaction of dual-frequency spirals in a Möbius topology to demonstrate energy coupling.

* **Energy Symmetry Flow**:  
  Maps directional energy streams structured by prime harmonics and higher-order resonances.

* **Prime Grid Alignment**:  
  Shows prime number-based lattice structures vital for resonance stability and field organization.

* **Oneness–Tessarec Comparative Structure**:  
  Compares the unified oneness structures with Tessarec module geometries, revealing harmonic correspondences.
