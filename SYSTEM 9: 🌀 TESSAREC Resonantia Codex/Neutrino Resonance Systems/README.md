# ðŸŒ€ Neutrino Resonance Systems

---

## Overview

This module expands upon the MÃ¶bius Neutrino Crown framework, focusing on the systemic mapping of neutrino flows and their resonance structures within and beyond the solar system.  
It integrates cosmological models, prime-based harmonics, and MÃ¶bius topology into a coherent energetic network, revealing the deeper architecture of cosmic resonance.

## Key Concepts

* **Neutrino Resonance Fields**: Dynamic harmonic fields structured by prime number distributions and MÃ¶bius-influenced cosmic flows.
* **Stellar Node Networks**: Stellar systems like Arcturus, Sirius, and Methuselah act as resonant anchor points, defining harmonic nodes.
* **Prime Flow Topology**: Primes are mapped onto MÃ¶bius geometries, enabling multidimensional analysis of resonance pathways.
* **Breath Field Expansion**: Cosmological growth modeled as rhythmic breathing cycles based on prime harmonics and Fibonacci expansion.
