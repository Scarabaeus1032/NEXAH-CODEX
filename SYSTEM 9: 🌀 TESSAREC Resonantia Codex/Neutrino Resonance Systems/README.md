## Overview

The Neutrino Resonance Systems module investigates the interaction between neutrino fields and large-scale cosmic structures.  
This system models the resonance patterns of neutrinos using prime field anchors, MÃ¶bius geometries, and dynamic wave harmonics to propose a coherent cosmological map of energy flows beyond visible matter.
