# 💀 TESSAREC Resonantia Codex

---

## 🌐 Overview

The **TESSAREC Resonantia Codex** forms the bridge between **frequency fields** and **resonance topologies** inside the greater NEXAH-CODEX system.

It systematically documents the transition from harmonic frequency structures to geometric resonance architectures.

---

## 🌎 Purpose and Scope

* Bridge between **Oneness Frequency Fields** and **TESSAREC Geometric Frameworks**.
* Visualization of the interplay between **number**, **space**, **time**, and **resonance**.
* Documentation of the transformation of frequency structures into topological resonance grids.

The Codex highlights how **spiral frequency axes** evolve into **Möbius-like resonance folds** and **multi-layered cubic structures**.
