## 📘 Overview

This module links to the completed Riemann Hypothesis proof concept in the symbolic field architecture of NEXAH-CODEX.  
The full module is hosted separately due to its foundational role in the prime lattice system.

## 🔗 Integration Pointers

- Aligns with `spiral-logic.md`, Möbius-Crown geometry, and `prime-delta-net.md`  
- Proof components extend into `ramanujan_euler_riemann.md` in the `codex-mathematics/` system  
- Symbolic zeta-spirals link to `visual_gallery.md` of the GRAND-CODEX
