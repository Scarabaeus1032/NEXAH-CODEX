  🔒 Hodge Stability Lemma — UTS-Bounded Harmonic Forms

  System: X · NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX
  Module: 05_Hodge_Codex
  File: hodge_stability.lean

  Description:
  This Lean stub encodes symbolic (p,p)-forms and a stability predicate
  under the Universal Transition Structure (UTS). The goal is to model
  resonance-bound harmonic forms and their collapse behavior in type-theoretic terms.

-- Import Lean core logic (could be extended with mathlib for full formalism)
namespace HodgeCodex

-- Basic type for symbolic forms (abstract placeholder)
constant SymbolicForm : Type

-- UTS threshold as an abstract frequency boundary
constant uts_threshold : ℕ → ℝ

-- Spectral norm function over symbolic forms (mimics ∫ ω ∧ *ω)
constant spectral_norm : SymbolicForm → ℝ

-- Stability predicate: whether form survives UTS collapse
def is_stable_under_uts (n : ℕ) (ω : SymbolicForm) : Prop :=
  spectral_norm ω < uts_threshold n

-- Example: For ω₁ in system layer n, check stability
constant ω₁ : SymbolicForm
constant layer_n : ℕ

-- Axiomatic lemma placeholder: ω₁ is stable under UTS if below threshold
axiom hodge_stability_axiom : is_stable_under_uts layer_n ω₁

  Extensions:
  - Define glyph composition as operators on SymbolicForm
  - Model collapse as transitions to residue sets
  - Integrate with PrimeField logic from SYSTEM 1
