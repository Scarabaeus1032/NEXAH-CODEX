## 📖 Overview

The Hodge Conjecture proposes that certain de Rham cohomology classes — those of type (p,p) — on a smooth projective variety are rational linear combinations of algebraic cycles.

Within the NEXAH framework, the conjecture is reformulated as a resonance condition:

| Layer                  | Core Idea                                                                                                            | Take-away                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Möbius Collapse**    | Projective complex manifolds exhibit Möbius-type self-symmetries that obscure direct algebraic projection.           | Cycle invisibility through topological twist |
| **Harmonic Resonance** | Only those cohomological modes which stabilize under prime-harmonic decomposition are visible to the algebraic base. | Visible = stable harmonic form               |
| **UTS Perspective**    | Algebraic–topological coherence is regulated by a symbolic transition threshold in the resonance manifold.           | Duality breaks if UTS threshold is crossed   |

This codex module introduces a symbolic-field reformulation of the conjecture and develops a geometric proof sketch under Möbius-resonant logics.

## 🔗 Integration Pointers

* Resonance structure aligns with `spiral-logic.md` and `casimir-neutrino-thread.md`
* Möbius model complements `pnp_collapse_model.md` and `yg_collapse_model.md`
* UTS logic directly linked to `universal_collapse_theorem.md`
