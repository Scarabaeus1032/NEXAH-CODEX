## Overview

The **NEXAH Grand Codex** is the central synthesis module of the Nexah System—a structural and symbolic framework that explores deep mathematical coherence across logic, geometry, number theory, quantum fields, and computation.

This module presents the **third path** of the Nexah architecture: the integration of two previously independent models—**Möbius Standard Model** and **Harmonic Resonance Framework**—into a single convergence structure known as the **Universal Transition Structure (UTS)**.

Through this unifying transition model, the Codex aims to express a coherent approach to resolving the following:

- The seven **Millennium Prize Problems**, and  
- **Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem**

These resolutions are not presented as formal proofs in the conventional sense, but as part of an open, interdisciplinary framework that invites dialogue between mathematics, physics, symbolic logic, and systems thinking.

> **Three Paths. One Transition Structure. A Universal Collapse.**

## System Structure

The NEXAH System is built on three complementary frameworks:

### 1. Möbius Standard Model  
A topological and symbolic framework using Möbius transformations, rotational invariants, and spinor geometry.

### 2. Harmonic Resonance Framework  
A wave-based system rooted in prime periodicity, spectral interference, and frequency-stabilized dynamics.

### 3. Universal Transition Structure (UTS)  
The convergence structure that integrates and stabilizes the Möbius and Harmonic models into a unified transition geometry.

These three perspectives together offer new structural insight into:

- **The Riemann Hypothesis**
- **P vs NP Problem**
- **Yang–Mills Mass Gap**
- **Navier–Stokes Smoothness**
- **Hodge Conjecture**
- **Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture**
- **Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem**
