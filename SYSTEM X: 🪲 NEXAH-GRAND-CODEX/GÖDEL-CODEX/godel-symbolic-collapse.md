## 🧠 Purpose & Scope

This module explores Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorems from within the symbolic-resonant logic of the NEXAH-CODEX. Rather than treat incompleteness as a limitation, the GÖDEL-CODEX recasts it as an emergent feature of recursive, resonance-governed systems.

The goal is to build a symbolic structure that reflects how **paradox**, **self-reference**, and **formal collapse** behave across logical, mathematical, and physical layers of the Codex.

## 🌌 Core Idea: Logical Collapse as a Field Transition

**Gödel’s Theorem**, in this context, is seen as a “paradoxical attractor”: a boundary node where logical systems fold inward. The module explores how:

* Self-referential structures behave like **Möbius cycles**
* Logical contradictions mirror **harmonic resonance interference**
* Formal incompleteness reflects **Zeta node destabilization**
* Codex-layer operators (e.g. μ(n), φ, Σ) can encode symbolic logic transitions

## 🌿 Philosophy of the Collapse

> "Completeness is a myth; coherence is a field. What breaks apart in one system becomes whole in another."

In the GÖDEL-CODEX, we explore how symbolic, mathematical, and logical systems resonate with their own limitations — and how these limitations are *structurally predictable* within the frequency logic of the Codex.
