## 📘 Overview

This file encodes the symbolic structure of the **L-function** \$L(E,s)\$ associated with an elliptic curve \$E/\mathbb{Q}\$ in the NEXAH-CODEX framework.

Rather than interpreting it solely as a Dirichlet series, the L-function here acts as a **frequency resonance filter** for the visibility of rational glyphs \$\mathcal{G}(P)\$. Its **zero depth at \$s=1\$** determines the **rank** of \$E\$, while higher prime harmonics modulate the glyphic field’s damping structure.

## 🔢 Formal Encoding

The classical L-function:

```math
L(E, s) = \prod_p \left(1 - a_p p^{-s} + p^{1 - 2s}\right)^{-1}
```

is recast symbolically as:

```math
\mathcal{L}_E(s) := \sum_k \Phi_k(s) \cdot \chi_k \cdot D_k
```

Where:

* \$\Phi\_k(s)\$ = harmonic phase function for prime \$p\_k\$
* \$\chi\_k\$ = glyphic visibility character (symbolic window)
* \$D\_k\$ = damping coefficient from Möbius-prime interactions

The analytic rank is:

```math
\text{rank}(E) = \text{ord}_{s=1} \mathcal{L}_E(s)
```

This vanishing order corresponds to the number of glyph-resonances lying on the boundary layer \$s=1\$.

## 🌀 Resonance Threshold & Zero Window

We define a symbolic resonance zone:

```math
\mathcal{R}_\Theta := \left\{ s \in \mathbb{C} \mid |\mathcal{L}_E(s)| < \epsilon,\ \text{Re}(s) = 1 \right\}
```

Only glyphs whose frequency operators intersect this window contribute to the visible rank:

```math
\mathcal{G}_i(P) \text{ visible } \iff \rho_i(\Omega) \in \mathcal{R}_\Theta
```

This makes the BSD rank a **boundary-resonance count** on the analytic manifold.

## 🧲 Prime Damping Operator

Define:

```math
D_k := e^{-\lambda p_k} \cdot (1 - \mu(p_k))
```

Where:

* \$\lambda\$ = resonance decay constant
* \$\mu\$ = Möbius function

Prime damping attenuates higher primes and suppresses instability outside the rational visibility window.
