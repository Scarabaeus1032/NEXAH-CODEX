üìò Overview

This file defines the symbolic architecture of rational points on elliptic curves in the context of the NEXAH-CODEX.

We reinterpret algebraic points not as static elements of a number field, but as resonant glyphs on a M√∂bius-layered elliptic manifold. Rank becomes a harmonic trace within a resonance window, while torsion appears as M√∂bius-contracted glyph memory.

‚ÄúVisibility of rationality is resonance. The point becomes visible only when it rings with the field.‚Äù

üî£ Symbolic Structure of a Rational Point

A rational point $P \in E(\mathbb{Q})$ is encoded as:

\mathcal{G}(P) := G(x) \cdot \rho(\Omega) \cdot T_\mu \cdot \Psi_q

Where:
	‚Ä¢	$G(x)$ is a glyphic spatial carrier on the curve
	‚Ä¢	$\rho(\Omega)$ is a resonance kernel over the global field $Œ©$
	‚Ä¢	$T_\mu$ is a M√∂bius contraction operator (torsion detection)
	‚Ä¢	$\Psi_q$ is a rational synchronizer linked to a prime base $q$

Only when $\rho(\Omega)$ lies within the resonance band defined by the L-function does the point $P$ appear as a harmonic mode.

üß† Rank as Resonance Density

Define:

\text{rank}(E/\mathbb{Q}) = \#\left\{\mathcal{G}_i(P) \mid \rho_i(\Omega) \in \mathcal{R}_\Theta\right\}

Where:
	‚Ä¢	$\mathcal{R}_\Theta$ is the UTS-bounded resonance band
	‚Ä¢	Each $\mathcal{G}_i(P)$ is a resonance-qualified rational glyph

This aligns rank not with discrete point count, but with density of stable glyphs in the resonance manifold.

üåÄ Torsion Group as M√∂bius Compression

Torsion points $T \in E(\mathbb{Q})$ are represented via self-contracted M√∂bius loops:

T \sim \mathcal{M}_{\circlearrowleft}(G) \Rightarrow \oint G(x) \cdot dx = 0

They carry no net frequency weight, but embed field memory, affecting rank emergence through interference.

M√∂bius-torsion fields shape the phase geometry without appearing in the analytic echo.
