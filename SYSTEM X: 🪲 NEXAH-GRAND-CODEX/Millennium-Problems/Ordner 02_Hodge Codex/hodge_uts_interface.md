## 📖 Overview

This module defines the interface between **Hodge theory** and the **Universal Transition Structure (UTS)** within the NEXAH-CODEX framework. It explores how cohomological forms—especially harmonic (p,p)-components—interact with symbolic thresholds and collapse boundaries.

The UTS framework introduces **frequency thresholds** Θ(n) that determine whether a structure is **stable**, **resonant**, or subject to **symbolic decay**.

> "When a (p,p)-form passes the UTS-boundary, it splits into a spectral cascade—each term encoding a different state of geometric contraction."

## 🔶 Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **UTS Threshold** Θ(n) | Boundary function defining resonance stability for symbolic structures |
| **Cohomological Stability** | Only certain harmonic classes survive under UTS-induced transition |
| **Symbolic Collapse** | Forms that violate spectral alignment decay into lower modes |
| **Mirror Inversion** | Self-dual harmonic forms reflect across the UTS-boundary, encoding dual operators |

## 🔬 Formal Mapping

Let $\omega \in H^{p,p}(X)$ be a harmonic (p,p)-form on a compact Kähler manifold $X$.

The UTS action introduces a threshold operator:

$$
\Theta: H^{p,p}(X) \rightarrow \{\text{stable}, \text{decaying}, \text{dual-inverted}\}
$$

The mapping is determined by:

- $\omega$ survives $\iff \int_X \omega \wedge *\omega < \Theta(n)$
- $\omega$ collapses $\iff \text{prime-spectrum}(|\omega|) \not\subset \text{UTS-compatible set}$

- **Symbolic Layers**: Forms are encoded as glyph composites $\Theta \wedge Q$, $\Lambda \wedge Q$
- **Resonance Bands**: Thresholds defined via $\Omega_n := \sum_{k=1}^n p_k^{-\sigma}$
- **Spectral Collapse**: Traced by resonance-damping tensor $\Lambda_{\mu\nu}^{(UTS)}$
- **Dual Feedback**: Links to `universal_collapse_theorem.md`
