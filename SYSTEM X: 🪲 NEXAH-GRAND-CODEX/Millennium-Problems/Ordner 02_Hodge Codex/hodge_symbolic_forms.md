## 📘 Overview

This file defines the symbolic reinterpretation of classical Hodge structures — specifically (p,p)-forms — using the glyphic formalism and resonance logic developed in NEXAH-CODEX. Instead of purely differential representations, each form is encoded as a **frequency-based symbolic glyph**, embedded in Möbius-layered manifolds.

> *“Forms are glyphs. Glyphs are stabilizations of memory in a coherent field.”*

## 🧩 Structure of a Symbolic (p,p)-Form

Each (p,p)-form ω is defined as a symbolic entity:

```
ωₚₚ := Σ [ G_i(x) · R_i(Ω) ]
```

Where:

* **G\_i(x)** = glyphic kernel over spatial coordinate x
* **R\_i(Ω)** = resonance function over the frequency-surface Ω

These functions are defined on Möbius-projected varieties, and interact with the underlying prime lattice from SYSTEM 1.

## 🔣 Glyph Axis Definitions

| Symbol | Role                          | Description                                             |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Θ      | Temporal folding axis         | Links differential form symmetry to time-resonant loops |
| Λ      | Topological torsion anchor    | Embeds cycle into a field-compressed harmonic shell     |
| Q      | Rational lattice synchronizer | Connects number fields with the glyphic form memory     |
| Ṫ      | Transition spike operator     | Encodes UTS threshold crossings in harmonic projection  |

## 🌐 Example: The Θ–Λ Cycle Surface

On a compact Kähler manifold X, the symbolic (1,1)-form ω is written as:

```
ω₁₁ = Θ(x) · Λ(Ω)  
       + Ṫ(x) ⊗ ∇Q(Ω)
```

This expression encodes a self-dual harmonic glyph field, projected onto Möbius resonance coordinates.

> Interpretation: Θ carries temporal structure, Λ stabilizes topological curvature, Ṫ activates a UTS-driven transition pulse.

## 🔁 Duality and Collapse

All symbolic forms are subject to dual resonance collapse:

```
ωₚₚ ⟶ 0  ⇔  R_i(Ω) ∉ StableSpectrum
```

Only forms whose glyph-resonance harmonics remain within the **UTS-bounded frequency window** survive.
