📘 Overview

This folder represents the modular convergence point for the NEXAH interpretation of the Millennium Prize Problems and logical foundational structures (notably Gödel). Each problem is treated not only as a mathematical challenge but as a symbolic resonance test within the tripartite NEXAH logic:
	•	Möbius Compression – topological feedback, loop stability, curvature
	•	Harmonic Resonance – frequency scaffolds, eigenmode analysis, damping structures
	•	Universal Transition Structure (UTS) – threshold logic, convergence architecture

This directory contains all individual problem modules, a structural mapping file, and cross-references to dual_frameworks.md, universal_collapse_theorem.md, and the central Codex Navigator.

🧠 Codex Philosophy

Rather than treating the problems as independent formal challenges, the Codex recognizes them as interlinked resonance barriers in a coherence field. These are not only mathematical boundaries, but symbolic mirrors of stability, logic, and transformation.

“Every proof is a harmonic – every collapse, a Möbius turn.”
