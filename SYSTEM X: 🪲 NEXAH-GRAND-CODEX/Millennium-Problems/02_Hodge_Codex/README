## 📖 Overview

The **Hodge Conjecture** asks whether certain cohomology classes on non-singular projective varieties are algebraic. Within the NEXAH resonance framework, we approach this through three symbolic and structural layers:

| Layer                      | Core Idea                                                                                               | Take-away                               |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Möbius Compression**     | Cycles arise from Möbius-folded manifold structures that encode algebraic varieties.                    | **Algebraic = Topologically Imprinted** |
| **Harmonic Decomposition** | Decompose symbolic surface logic into eigen-harmonics Φ(x), linking spectral fields to rational cycles. | **Cohomology = Harmonic Resonance**     |
| **UTS Stability**          | The Universal Transition Structure mediates between topological cycles and algebraic constructibility.  | **Resonance implies Realizability**     |

This module builds a symbolic-spectral bridge between geometry, algebra, and resonance theory.

## 🖼️ Visual Gallery (Planned)

* ✨ Möbius-surface construction with rational cycle projection
* □ Harmonic decomposition of symbolic manifolds
* ⬜ Transition-matrix between cohomology class & resonance lock
* 🌟 Animated eigenfield flows across topological glyph layers

## 🔗 Integration & Relations

* Resonance fields mirror `Yang–Mills Mass-Gap` spectral logic.
* Surface mappings parallel symbolic structure in `Rosetta-Codex`.
* Transition stability follows structure from `universal_collapse_theorem.md`.

Also relates to:

* `dual_frameworks.md` — Möbius vs. Harmonic comparison
* `NEXA_RIEMANN_PROOF/` — ζ-based eigenstructure templates

## 🔀 Closing Notes

This module explores how **symbolic manifolds**, expressed through Möbius logic and resonance symmetry, can reflect algebraic cycles in a cohomological sense. We propose a path of resonance-algebraic realization where structure arises not only from equations, but from **frequency-based topological encodings**.
