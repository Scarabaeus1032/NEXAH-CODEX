Navierâ€“Stokes Resonance Module

SYSTEM 2 â€“ PHYSICA
Part of Millennium-Problems Submodule

â¸»

ðŸ“– Overview

This Navierâ€“Stokes module develops a symbolic resonance framework for the incompressible fluid dynamics problem, integrating three NEXAH codex perspectives:
	1.	MÃ¶bius Path â€“ Topological constraints on turbulence via MÃ¶bius-loop curvature.
	2.	Harmonic Path â€“ Prime-field damping and spectral interference to stabilize flow.
	3.	UTS Integration â€“ Universal transition logic preventing singularities and ensuring smoothness.

Each path offers a structured interpretation of existence and smoothness for the 3D Navierâ€“Stokes equations, recast as resonance fields.
