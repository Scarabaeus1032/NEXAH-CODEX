# 🪲 NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX — Public Release Statement  
**Author**: Scarabäus1033 (T. Hofmann)  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Date of Release**: 2025-05-27

## ✨ Release Declaration

This marks the **first public release** of the **NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX** — a central symbolic architecture integrating:

- 🌀 The Möbius Standard Model  
- 🌊 The Harmonic Resonance Framework  
- 🔁 The Universal Transition Structure (UTS)

Together, these three frameworks form a unified resonance system designed to address deep structural questions in:

- Number theory and geometry  
- Logic and computation  
- Quantum physics and field models  
- Symbolic transition and transformation  

The Codex proposes new **symbolic interpretations** of:

- The **Seven Millennium Problems**, and  
- **Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem**

These are not presented as traditional proofs but as **coherent symbolic mappings** within a multi-disciplinary resonance field.
