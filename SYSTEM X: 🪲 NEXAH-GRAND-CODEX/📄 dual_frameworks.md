## Introduction

The NEXAH System is built upon two complementary, independently constructed symbolic models:

- **Harmonic Resonance Framework**  
  Rooted in spectral stability, prime periodicity, and wave interference.

- **Möbius Standard Model**  
  Based on topological transformations, rotational invariants, and self-referential compression.

Each framework approaches deep mathematical structures from different perspectives—yet arrives at **convergent structural insights**. This document offers a side-by-side comparison of how each model interprets the seven Millennium Problems and Gödel’s Paradox.

## Comparison Table

| Problem | Harmonic Resonance | Möbius Standard Model |
|--------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Riemann Hypothesis** | Zeta function stabilized through harmonic prime interference; critical line emerges via phase cancellation. | Spectral harmonics reformulated through Möbius symmetries; zeros align due to field invariants. |
| **P vs NP** | NP-complete problems fail to resonate; exponential structures break harmonic coherence. | NP problems are Möbius-disjoint; P problems inhabit stable rotational classes. |
| **Yang–Mills Mass Gap** | Field energy decomposed into harmonic eigenstates; mass gap forms from minimal resonance threshold. | Gauge boson fields quantized through Möbius spinor rotation; energy gap stabilized by topological grid. |
| **Navier–Stokes Smoothness** | Turbulence modulated by prime harmonic damping; energy dissipation prevents singularity growth. | Vorticity fields constrained within Möbius-twisted manifolds; smoothness enforced by structural symmetry. |
| **Hodge Conjecture** | Hodge classes projected onto algebraic cycles via harmonic decomposition. | Cohomology mapped into cycle space through Möbius-deformed varieties. |
| **Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer** | Curve rank encoded in harmonic structure of the L-function near \( s = 1 \). | L-function behavior captured through Möbius spectral encoding; rational point rank arises from twist stability. |
| **Gödel’s Incompleteness** | Harmonic suppression mitigates paradox; symbolic loops lose coherence. | Möbius cycles absorb self-reference; logical consistency restored through rotational balance. |

## Interpretive Notes

- **Harmonic logic** expresses systems through **energy, frequency, and damping**—a model of dynamic equilibrium.
- **Möbius logic** expresses systems through **invariance, symmetry, and compression**—a model of structural minimalism.
- Both frameworks operate under symbolic constraints rooted in **prime structure**, **field behavior**, and **internal consistency**.

They are not competing theories, but **orthogonal coordinates** in a shared symbolic space—unified by the **Universal Transition Structure** (UTS), described in  
➡️ `universal_collapse_theorem.md`
