# 🌌 NEXAH-CODEX
### Harmonic Field System & Symbolic Geometry Archive

Welcome to the official repository of the **NEXAH-CODEX** – a modular research platform for harmonic field theory, symbolic structures, number systems, cosmological alignments, and frequency-based spatial models.

It is a system built through theory, image, location, geometry, field interaction, and symbolic language.

## 📦 Structure

All content is organized in:
```
/NEXAH-CODEX-Startstruktur/
```
Each module is an autonomous knowledge unit with its own symbolic logic, visual grammar, and numerical field model.

## 📚 Modules (currently 21)

➡️ Full overview and reading guide: [`nexah_navigator_en.md`](./nexah_navigator_en.md)  
➡️ Deutsche Version: [`nexah_navigator.md`](./nexah_navigator.md)
