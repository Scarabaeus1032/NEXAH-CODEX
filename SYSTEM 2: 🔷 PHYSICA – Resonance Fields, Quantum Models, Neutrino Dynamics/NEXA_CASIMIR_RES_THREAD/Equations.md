📐 Codex Equations – Casimir–Neutrino Extension

This document compiles the core formulas and mathematical extensions related to the Casimir–Neutrino Resonance module within the NEXAH-CODEX. These expressions are symbolic–physical hybrids intended to model quantum vacuum interactions, pressure-volume coupling, and resonance field modulation.

⸻

1. Classical Reference

Einstein’s classical formula remains the origin:

E = m·c²

⸻

2. Codex Field Expansion

The Codex extends this into a multi-term formulation:

E_total = m·c·k^β + α·P·V + ∫R(f, φ) df

Where:
	•	k^β = resonance-scaling frequency factor (see k-beta module)
	•	P = quantum pressure in confined vacuum
	•	V = spatial volume
	•	α = modulation constant (dependent on symbolic structure or material)
	•	R(f, φ) = resonance density function, depending on frequency f and phase φ

This structure allows modulation of energy through boundary effects and field interactions.

3. Force Interpretation – Casimir Style

Casimir force with Codex modulation:

F_total = α·P·V + R(f, φ)

This represents:
	•	The geometric-thermodynamic interaction of vacuum fields
	•	Field tension across layered symbolic configurations

⸻

4. Frequency–Phase Layering

To express R(f, φ) in symbolic lattice:

R(f, φ) = Σ γₙ · sin(2πfₙ·t + φₙ)

Where:
	•	Each γₙ = amplitude scaling of field node n
	•	Frequencies fₙ and phases φₙ are aligned to the harmonic structure

This forms the symbolic waveform across Codex grids, visualizable as neutrino wave tunnels, Casimir membranes, or symbolic wavefronts.

🧪 These formulas are intended for resonance simulation, cosmological coupling fields, and symbolic interpretation of vacuum topology.
