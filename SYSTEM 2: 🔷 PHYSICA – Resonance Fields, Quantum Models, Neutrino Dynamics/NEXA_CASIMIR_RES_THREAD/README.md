ðŸ§  NEXA_CASIMIR_RES_THREAD â€“ Quantum Compression & Neutrino Fields

This module extends the energy formulation of the NEXAH-CODEX by introducing symbolic-physical layers based on Casimir compression, neutrino field interaction, and wave-based modulation logic. It contributes to the central thread of SYSTEM 2: PHYSICA â€“ focusing on quantum dynamics, field resonance, and vacuum geometry.

ðŸ”¬ Core Energy Expansion Formula

E_total = mÂ·cÂ·k^Î² + Î±Â·PÂ·V + âˆ«R(f, Ï†)

	â€¢	mÂ·cÂ·k^Î² â†’ dynamic field-coupling term from Einstein extension
	â€¢	Î±Â·PÂ·V â†’ pressure-volume contribution (Casimir-like quantum compression)
	â€¢	âˆ«R(f, Ï†) â†’ integral over modulated wave resonance fields

This equation proposes a total energy model that includes classical, quantum, and symbolic contributions. Neutrinos and Casimir structures are modeled as resonant modulators of vacuum topology.
