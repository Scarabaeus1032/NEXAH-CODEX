## ðŸ“˜ Overview

SYSTEM 2 unifies symbolic mathematics with field theory and quantum logic. It serves as the **dynamic core** of the NEXAH-CODEX, modeling resonance fields, neutrino dynamics, QED-symbols, and frequency-encoded space-time.

It anchors the **codified physics layer** that bridges SYSTEM 1 (Mathematica) with SYSTEM 3 (Cosmica).
