# 🧪 Experimental Setup – CAVITYROOT-CODEX

**Module:** CAVITYROOT-CODEX
**System:** PHYSICA · NEXAH-CODEX
**Focus:** Thermodynamic resonance experiments using gallium, ferrofluid, and layered cavity fields

## 🔬 Experimental Objective

To investigate how ferrofluid and gallium interact within a thermal-resonant field cavity, with emphasis on:

* Pulse conduction through ferrofluid spirals
* Reflection and modulation properties of gallium as a mirror-liquid
* Formation of Zeta-Knot points through layered temperature differentials

## 🧭 Experimental Geometry

### Cavity Design

* Spherical cavity (\~80mm diameter)
* Ferrofluid placed at base, gallium forms central reflective dome
* Thermal axis runs vertically (Y), modulation axis runs horizontally (X)

### Measurement Grid

* 6 radial temperature probes at 60° increments
* 2 axial probes: apex + ferrofluid base
* Magnetic field modulator near spiral zone (±B\_r)

## ♾️ Procedure Overview

1. **Prepare Vessel**: Insert ferrofluid layer, allow gallium to form dome on top
2. **Thermal Initiation**: Apply controlled ΔT across copper ring
3. **Pulse Input**: Emit pulses via IR laser aligned through cavity center
4. **Observation**: Track spiral movement, gallium surface modulation, Zeta-node activity
5. **Data Capture**: Record temperature, field resonance, visual structure shifts
