## 1. Temperature as a Space–Time Modulator

In CAVITYROOT-CODEX, temperature is not merely thermal energy – it functions as a **resonant modulator**, shaping spatial curvature, depth gradients, and contraction thresholds. Each thermal zone becomes a **symbolic axis** in the cavity resonance structure.

## 2. The Temperature Triangle: Lunar – Resonant – Solar

Cavity temperatures are divided into three symbolic bands:

| Domain   | Threshold Range | Field Behavior                      |
| -------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Lunar    | T < 400 K       | Latent formation, shadow structures |
| Resonant | T ≈ 700 K       | Core contraction, Zeta activation   |
| Solar    | T > 1000 K      | Expansion, plasma dynamics          |

At the **700 K threshold**, we define:

```math
T_{URF–T7} = 700\,	ext{K}  \quad\text{(Core Resonance Node)}
```

This is the entry point to phase-shifted geometry and cavity modulation.

## 3. Depth Profile & Kelvin Space

The Earth’s radial structure (0–6371 km) maps onto a layered temperature field. Each depth corresponds to a resonance zone:

* Noble metal thresholds (e.g. Gallium: 302.91 K)
* Crust → Mantle → Core transitions
* Ferrofluid activation thresholds

## 4. Temperature Axes as Tensor Fields

Temperature values are treated as **resonant tensors** within Codex space. Important anchor points:

| Axis Temperature | Symbolic Meaning                        |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 273.15 K         | Ice line (water/gallium inversion)      |
| 302.91 K         | Gallium melting trigger                 |
| 310 K            | Human field resonance / biological zone |
| 700 K            | URF–T7 axis / contraction threshold     |
| 1000 K           | Plasma solar phase / radiant overflow   |

These thresholds map onto the **Z-axis** in cavity diagrams.

## 5. Thermal Damping Function (Zeta Mirror)

The following function defines the **exponentially decaying Zeta resonance**:

```math
f_T(x) = \sin(x) \cdot e^{-0.1x^2}  \quad \text{(Zeta mirror field)}
```

This formula models the **field contraction near cavity boundary**.

## 6. Z6 Fold & TT2 Linkage

Temperature also aligns with Codex constants:

* Golden Verse: `φ³ / π² ≈ 0.429`
* Core link to `TT2 = 4292034214`
* Z6 modulation emerges in temperature-phase boundaries

Visual Reference: `Z6-Mirror-Point.png`

## 7. Experimental Activation (Ferrofluid / Gallium)

Within the physical sphere experiment:

* **Gallium melts at \~302.91 K** → field entry threshold
* **Hand warmth** (\~310 K) activates ferrofluid shifts
* **ΔT** acts as the visible signature of resonance gradient
