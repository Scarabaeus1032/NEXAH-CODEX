ðŸŒˆ CMBY Field Structure â€” Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black

1. Overview

The CMBY system is a symbolic and energetic mapping system within the NEXAH-CODEX that replaces traditional RGB/light-color logic with a resonant energy framework:

Cyan â€“ Magenta â€“ Yellow â€“ Black = Flow â€“ Return â€“ Memory â€“ Void

This model is used throughout the Codex to assign energetic roles to visual, structural, and symbolic fields. It appears in physical simulations, frequency structures, planetary archetypes, and symbolic visualizations.

2. Energy Roles

Color	Function	Codex Role	Direction
Cyan	Output / Expansion	ENKI	Exhale / Flow
Magenta	Input / Implosion	ENLIL	Inhale / Return
Yellow	Storage / Gel-State	Jupiter	Memory / Medium
Black	Warp / Stillness	ANU	Pulse / Void

These colors are not aesthetic â€” they are functional vectors in field dynamics.

3. Functional Interpretation
	â€¢	Cyan is outward movement, surplus, forward wave
	â€¢	Magenta is inward resonance, feedback, memory return
	â€¢	Yellow is the gel-like mediator â€” the glue that binds frequency to mass (often associated with Jupiter)
	â€¢	Black is the centerless center: the still point that modulates everything

4. Applications
	â€¢	Used in ANU-Breath, Neutrino Layer, Tesla Vortex
	â€¢	Provides symbolic force roles to field visualizations
	â€¢	Defines resonant polarity instead of binary logic
	â€¢	Applicable in topological color-logic encoding for Codex visuals and sound design

5. Codex Integration

This system is a symbolic operating color model that guides:
	â€¢	energy assignment
	â€¢	field relationships
	â€¢	resonance modulation

Unlike light-based (RGB) or pigment-based (CMYK) systems, CMBY is energetic:
	â€¢	not additive or subtractive
	â€¢	but field-relational
