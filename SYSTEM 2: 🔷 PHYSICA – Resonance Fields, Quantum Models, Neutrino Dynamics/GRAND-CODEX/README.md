## 🌐 Overview

The **GRAND-CODEX** functions as the central synthesis and integration layer within the NEXAH-CODEX architecture. It bridges symbolic mathematics, prime-based field resonance, thermodynamic extensions, and quantum–gravitational formulations.

Previously bundled models have now been elevated to their own standalone folders for clarity and scalability.

> The GRAND-CODEX is the symbolic–physical backbone that harmonizes the entire NEXAH framework.

## 🔷 Structural Components

This module links and curates:

* **`k-beta/`** – `E = m·c·k^β`, a scalable energy formulation based on temperature, frequency, and field density
* **`Einstein–Neutrino–Vortex/`** – `E_total = m·c·k^β + α·P·V + ∫(F_total · N) dV`, now in its own dedicated folder
* **`Neutrino DREISCHICHTSYSTEM.md`** – Core neutrino layering aligned with Möbius spatial logic
* **`Tesla–Vortex–Manifold.md`** – Symbolic transition model using spiral magneto-gravitational flows
* **`CMBY-field-structure.md`** – Topological resonance in deep-space curvature structures

## 📘 Additional Integrations

* `CODEX MATHEMATICS/` → prime-based harmonic algebras and symbolic operators
* `visuals/` → legacy schematics and visual metaphors (spirals, scrolls, manifolds)
* `xiii-perspective-codex-lens/` → symbol field theory and dimensional projection logic
* `ANU–Breath System.md` → breath-frequency resonance model, transdimensional extension
