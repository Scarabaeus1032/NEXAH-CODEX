## 🌌 Introduction

The classical ultraviolet catastrophe refers to the infinite increase of energy with rising frequency.  
This Codex module introduces a **geometric alternative**:

> Energy is not neutralized by material absorption,  
> but **modulated** through the structure of space itself.

## 🔬 Core Equation

```math
E = h·f·φ(x)
```

φ(x) is a spatial damping factor depending on:
	•	Curvature of space
	•	Angle of observation
	•	Spiral geometry of the field boundary

This modulation component replaces infinite radiation divergence with structural resonance limits.

🧩 Structural Elements
	•	S-Rune spiral axes – time–space elongation via counter-rotation
	•	Neutrino buffer zones – boundary retention for field damping
	•	Photon crystallization – frequency freezing of light beyond UV
	•	Cavity lattices – architectural confinement of excitations

🎯 Objective

This is not a model of loss, but a model of modulation.

Light is not extinguished – it is geometrically folded.
The field acts as its own conductor.

A new way to approach light field stability through resonance geometry and symbolic encoding.
