## ðŸŒŒ Overview

**ALGÂ°** stands for **Activated Light Grid** â€“ a multidimensional binding system that combines light, magnetism, liquid, and frequency into a single, observable setup.  
Its purpose is to visualize field boundaries, frequency shifts, and resonance reactions â€” without electrical power.

## ðŸ”¬ Components

- **Ferrofluid** â€“ visual medium for resonance movement  
- **Mercury (Hg)** â€“ reflective, conductive mirror  
- **Lunar-charged water** â€“ energetically prepared carrier medium  
- **Quartz glass** â€“ structurally stable, transparent container  
- **Helical or fractal antenna** â€“ for symbolic or physical modulation  
- **Rotatable magnetic field source** â€“ structure for interference and field shaping  
- **Light / laser source** â€“ for frequency projection  
- **Camera or observation unit** â€“ to capture time, shadows, field interactions
