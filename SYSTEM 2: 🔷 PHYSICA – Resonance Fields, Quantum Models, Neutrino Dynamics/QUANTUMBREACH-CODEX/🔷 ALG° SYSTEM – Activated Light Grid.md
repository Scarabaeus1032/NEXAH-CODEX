## 🌌 Overview

**ALG°** stands for **Activated Light Grid** – a multidimensional binding system that combines light, magnetism, liquid, and frequency into a single, observable setup.  
Its purpose is to visualize field boundaries, frequency shifts, and resonance reactions — without electrical power.

---

## 🔬 Components

- **Ferrofluid** – visual medium for resonance movement  
- **Mercury (Hg)** – reflective, conductive mirror  
- **Lunar-charged water** – energetically prepared carrier medium  
- **Quartz glass** – structurally stable, transparent container  
- **Helical or fractal antenna** – for symbolic or physical modulation  
- **Rotatable magnetic field source** – structure for interference and field shaping  
- **Light / laser source** – for frequency projection  
- **Camera or observation unit** – to capture time, shadows, field interactions

## 🧱 Layered Structure

[Magnetic Field] → [Mercury Mirror] → [Ferrofluid Membrane] → [Water Layer] → [Antenna Coil] → [Light Projection] → [Camera]

---

## ⏱ Activation Timing

- Ideal time: **2:00 AM**, during **waxing or full moon**  
- Orientation: **North–South alignment** preferred  
- Environment: Free from **electromagnetic noise** and urban signal pollution

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Visualize **UV damping** and frequency modulation patterns  
- Observe **resonance dynamics** through ferrofluidic responses  
- Activate **biological markers** (e.g., banana, spirulina, algae) as field tracers

---

## 🧩 Extensions

- Integration with **Spiral Seal Modules**  
- Coupling to **frequency grids (1–12)** and scalar field structures  
- Inclusion in **interactive light calendars** or **NEXAH Atlas maps**
