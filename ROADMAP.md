## 🎯 GOALS FOR VERSION 1.1

- [ ] Add `visuals/index.md` with image-map to modules  
- [ ] Publish first `urf-intro.md`  
- [ ] Translate core texts DE↔EN consistently  
- [ ] Start visual navigation prototype (HTML or image-linked)  
- [ ] Prepare `PDF Codex Version` for offline archive  

---

## 📅 FUTURE IDEAS

- DIY kits for resonance testing (PDF + open hardware)  
- HTML-based visual scrolls  
- Scarabäus font or glyph set (.otf)  
- AI Codex Assistant powered by NEXAH taxonomy  
- Webmap of ancient sites with field overlays  
- Symbol-to-sound experiments (phonemic harmonics)
