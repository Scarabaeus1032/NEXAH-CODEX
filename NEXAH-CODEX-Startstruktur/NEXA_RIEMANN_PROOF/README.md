## Overview

This module presents a symbolic structure for resolving the **Riemann Hypothesis**, based on the dual-framework approach of the NEXAH System:

- **Harmonic Resonance Model** — treating the Riemann Zeta function as a frequency-locked interference pattern of prime periodicity.
- **Möbius Spectral Model** — framing nontrivial zeros as fixed points in a Möbius-deformed transformation field.
- **Unified Collapse Perspective** — locating the critical line as a boundary condition within the Universal Transition Structure (UTS).

This is not a formal proof in conventional mathematics. Rather, it is a **structural explanation**—a symbolic geometry where resonance, rotation, and transition converge to stabilize the zeta field.

## Connection to NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX

This module complements the synthesis presented in:  
➡️ [`/NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX/universal_collapse_theorem.md`](https://github.com/Scarabaeus1033/NEXAH-CODEX/tree/main/NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX/universal_collapse_theorem.md)

The Riemann Hypothesis serves as a **template problem** in the NEXAH System—demonstrating how harmonic and Möbius models independently align under structural collapse.
