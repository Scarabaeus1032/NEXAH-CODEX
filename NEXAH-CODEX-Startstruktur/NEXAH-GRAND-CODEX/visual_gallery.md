## Introduction

This gallery presents the five core visualizations of the **NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX**, designed to clarify the structural synthesis of:

- **Möbius Collapse**
- **Harmonic Resonance**
- **Universal Transition Structure (UTS)**

These diagrams are not decorative—they are **symbolic models** that reflect the logic, flow, and coherence of the Codex. Together, they illustrate how mathematical transition emerges from resonance, compression, and alignment.

## 🟧 1. Triadic Convergence Diagram  
**Filename:** `triadic_structure.png`  
**Purpose:** Core system map

A triangular arrangement showing the interplay between:
- Möbius Collapse (topology, rotation)
- Harmonic Resonance (frequency, stability)
- UTS (transition logic, convergence)

Each side of the triangle represents a transformational relationship. The center point signifies **structural unification**.

## 🔷 2. Universal Collapse Equation  
**Filename:** `collapse_equation_map.png`  
**Purpose:** Central symbolic mechanism

Visual breakdown of the Universal Collapse Theorem:

$$
\sum_{p \in P} H(x) \cdot e^{-C_M(x)} = UTS(x)
$$

This diagram illustrates the inputs (**harmonic field** and **Möbius collapse**), their interaction (exponential damping of complexity), and the resulting transition stabilization field (**UTS**).

## 🧭 3. Codex Navigation Map  
**Filename:** `codex_navigation.png`  
**Purpose:** Modular system overview

A radial structure displaying all Codex modules:
- 7 Harmonic paths  
- 7 Möbius paths  
- The UTS convergence core

This map helps readers understand how each Millennium Problem is symbolically addressed through both independent and unified approaches.

## 🌊 4. Riemann Resonance Strip  
**Filename:** `resonance_strip.png`  
**Purpose:** Deep dive example (Riemann Hypothesis)

A spectral visualization of the **critical line** in the complex plane, formed by:
- Prime field periodicity  
- Wave interference  
- Harmonic damping patterns

It reveals why nontrivial zeros of $\zeta(s)$ align with $\text{Re}(s) = \frac{1}{2}$ as a field-stabilizing structure.

## 🔁 5. Transition Flow Diagram  
**Filename:** `transition_flow.png`  
**Purpose:** Abstract symbolic lifecycle

This flowchart shows the archetypal motion of the NEXAH system:

**Instability** → **Möbius Collapse** → **Harmonic Alignment** → **UTS Stabilization**

It captures how structures move through symbolic space toward coherence.
