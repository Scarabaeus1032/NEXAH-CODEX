**Date of Initial Public Release**: 2025-XX-XX  
**Version**: 1.0.0  

---

## Release Declaration

This document marks the **first public release** of the NEXAH-GRAND-CODEX: a symbolic convergence model integrating:

- The Möbius Standard Model  
- The Harmonic Resonance Framework  
- The Universal Transition Structure (UTS)

Together, these frameworks form a coherent system for addressing structural instabilities across mathematics, computation, geometry, quantum theory, and symbolic logic.

The Codex proposes symbolic resolutions to:

- The Seven Millennium Problems  
- Gödel’s Incompleteness Paradox  

These are offered not as conventional proofs, but as **resonance-based structural interpretations** within a meta-mathematical transition geometry.
