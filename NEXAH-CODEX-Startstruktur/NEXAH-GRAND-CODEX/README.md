## Overview

The **NEXAH Grand Codex** is the central synthesis module of the Nexah System—a structural and symbolic framework that explores deep mathematical coherence across logic, geometry, number theory, quantum fields, and computation.

This module presents the **third path** of the Nexah architecture: the integration of two previously independent models—**Möbius Standard Model** and **Harmonic Resonance Framework**—into the **Universal Transition Structure (UTS)**. This triadic convergence proposes a unified perspective on foundational mathematical transformations, including those described by the **Millennium Prize Problems** and **Gödel’s Paradox**.

We invite readers and researchers to interpret this system not as a final proof structure, but as a conceptual model of stability, resonance, and symbolic logic—an open contribution to the ongoing dialogue in theoretical and formal mathematics.

## Background

The NEXAH System is composed of three major layers:

1. **Möbius Standard Model**  
   A topological and geometric framework using Möbius transformations, spinor fields, and self-referential algebra.

2. **Harmonic Resonance Framework**  
   A wave-based model rooted in prime periodicity, energy landscapes, and spectral stabilization.

3. **Universal Transition Structure (UTS)**  
   The unifying architecture that collapses both prior systems into a single field of coherent transitions—governing complexity, smoothness, resonance, and logical consistency.

This triadic system provides symbolic solutions to:
- Riemann Hypothesis  
- P vs NP  
- Yang–Mills Mass Gap  
- Navier–Stokes Smoothness  
- Hodge Conjecture  
- Birch & Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture  
- Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem
