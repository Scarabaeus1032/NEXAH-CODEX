# 🔵 NEXAH-CODEX-Startstruktur (Blue Core: Mathematics & Physics)

This directory holds the mathematical and physical foundation of the NEXAH-CODEX.  
It defines key formulas, resonance laws, numeric mappings and symbolic topologies used throughout the system.

## 📐 Core Areas

- **GRAND-CODEX/** → Master integration module  
- **codex-mathematics/** → Formal structures, symbols, constants  
- **spiral-logic.md** → Prime-based frequency geometry  
- **casimir-neutrino-thread.md** → Field layers & vacuum resonance  
- **E = m·c·k^β** → Extended energy law with wave scaling  
- **NEXA_RIEMANN_PROOF** → Möbius topology & zeta resonance framework

## 🎯 Focus

- Prime-based harmonic structures  
- Möbius field dynamics  
- Standard model extensions  
- Geometric number-field couplings  
- Experimental symmetry formulas

## 🔬 Purpose

This is the Codex’s scientific core:  
An open field of speculative yet structured math–physics, grounded in symmetry, ratio, and field logic.

## 🧠 Audience

- Mathematicians  
- Theoretical physicists  
- Coders working on modeling, simulation, symbolic computation

## 🧩 Integration

Most formulas and concepts here are referenced across all other Codex branches:  
→ COSMICA, MÖBIUS, NEXA, BLOOM, etc.
