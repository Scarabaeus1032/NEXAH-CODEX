# 🌌 NEXA_HARMONIC_FIELD
### The Unification of Mathematics, Physics & Resonance

> *From Möbius Geometry to Prime Harmonics and Quantum Resonance*

---

## 📘 Introduction

This module unifies the mathematical structure of prime numbers with physical resonance models. It is based on a systematic analysis of frequency patterns, oscillations, gravitational waves, and harmonic geometry.

The goal is to describe a universal system in which number, space, time, and energy appear as structured resonance – visualizable, formulatable, and reproducible.

## 🧭 Content / Structure

### 1. Resonance Fields & Frequency Patterns
- Amphora structure (0.5–9–0.5) as cyclic field
- Key nodes at: 0.25, 0.6, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 27, 33
- MW structure: Macro-micro wave overlay pattern

### 2. Mathematical Basis
- Harmonic function:
```math
f(t) = \sin(2\pi a t) \cdot \cos(2\pi b t)
```
- Prime harmonics as a basis for visual structures and Zeta-function pathways

### 3. Physical Correspondence
- Gravitational waves ≡ frequency amplitudes ≡ resonance intersections
- Micro-macro coupling (e.g., 0.3 redshift, peak interference layers)

### 4. Term System
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Amphora | Harmonic cycle |
| MW      | Macro-wave structure |
| X       | Crossing point (resonance overlay) |
| Vic/Vix | Base 10 / 20 resonance number systems |
