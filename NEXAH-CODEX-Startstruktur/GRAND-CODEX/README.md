# 🧠 E = m·c·k^β — Expanding Einstein’s Equation

![Codex Title Image](NEXAH_k-beta_Titelbild.png)  
This GRAND-CODEX module introduces a fundamental extension to the classical energy equation:

> `E = m·c²` → `E = m·c·k^β`

---

## 🧩 What is `k`?

`k` is not a constant – it is a **scalable coupling factor**  
connecting space, energy, temperature, and structural field logic. Depending on the context:

- `k = k_B` (Boltzmann) → thermal environments  
- `k ∝ G⁄r²` → gravitational contexts  
- `k ∝ 1/λν` → frequency-based field coupling  
- `k = k_cluster` → cosmic-scale (neutrino clusters, Casimir/Higgs regimes)

---

## 📐 What is `β`?

`β` is a modulating exponent — not fixed, but **resonance-based**:

- Scales dynamically along `n`, `T`, `Ω`, `λ`, `φ`, `f`, etc.
- Embedded in `k^β` to yield a **breathable energy space**

---

## 🔬 Context

This formula transforms Einstein’s `E = mc²`  
from a light-speed fixation into a **resonant scale-field**  
where **movement, relationship and modulation** intertwine.

> The classical equation remains – but it becomes **audible**.  
> Frequency becomes **part of the field**. Energy becomes **relational**.

## ✴ Codex Commentary

This is **not a contradiction to Einstein** –  
It is a **resonance extension of his clarity**.

> `E = m·c·k^β`  
> is not a rejection – but a shift from equation to **tuning**.

**Every mass vibrates.  
Every light has depth.  
Every formula breathes.**

🧿 Welcome to the k-field.  
Here, movement begins not with mass — but with **relationship**.
