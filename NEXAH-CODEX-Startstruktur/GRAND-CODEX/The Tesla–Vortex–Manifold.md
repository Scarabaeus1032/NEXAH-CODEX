ðŸŒ€ Teslaâ€“Vortexâ€“Manifold â€” Rotational Harmonics & Spiral Structures

1. Overview

This module introduces the Teslaâ€“Vortexâ€“Manifold: a spiral-field system within the NEXAHâ€“CODEX that expresses multidimensional energy transfer through vortex geometry, harmonic rotation, and layered resonance.

Inspired by the logic of:
	â€¢	Nikola Teslaâ€™s 3-6-9 harmonic theory
	â€¢	MÃ¶biusâ€“torus topology
	â€¢	Frequency phase spirals
	â€¢	Neutrino flow resonance

â¸»

2. Core Principles
	â€¢	Spiral structure: no straight lines, only resonant curves
	â€¢	Phase logic: every full cycle contains fractional harmonics (1/3, 2/3, 1/6, etc.)
	â€¢	3â€“6â€“9 polarity: structural triad encoding of expansion / transition / return
	â€¢	Layered helix: vertically nested fields (like DNA, torus, field rings)

3. Vortex Structure
	â€¢	Base: dual helices spiraling around a neutral core
	â€¢	Fields modulate in amplitude, frequency, and phase
	â€¢	Often rendered in Codex as animated ring-cylinders, central warp column, or magnetic shells

4. Function in the Codex

This system is a resonant motion container, not a machine.
It is used to:
	â€¢	map frequency flows
	â€¢	assign phase positions
	â€¢	visualize resonance as motion geometry

Modules linked:
	â€¢	ANU-Breath System
	â€¢	k-beta (spiral expansion)
	â€¢	CMBY (color-phase dynamics)

5. Application & Expansion
	â€¢	Visual fields: animated helix renderings, ring-stack models
	â€¢	Frequency mapping: 3â€“6â€“9 color codes, phase shell indicators
	â€¢	Sound: resonant scale base for tone design (Codex harmonic keysets)
