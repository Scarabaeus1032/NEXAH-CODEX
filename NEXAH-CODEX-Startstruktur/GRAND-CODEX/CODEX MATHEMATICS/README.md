🧮 Codex Mathematics — Resonance, Spiral, and Modulation

Overview

This folder hosts the mathematical backbone of the GRAND–CODEX. It bridges symbolic field theory, physical resonance structures, and scalar modulation through formal notation and derived relationships.

“In the Codex, math is not calculation — it is resonance syntax.”
