05 – Visual & Symbolic Mapping

Linking Formulas, Fields & Interaction Systems

🎯 Purpose of this Chapter

This chapter forms the bridge between mathematical structure (Ch. 01–04) and the visual, symbolic & interactive components of the URF Tensor Space. It shows how formulas, operators, and fields are translated into:
	•	Visuals
	•	Navigation systems
	•	Portal structures

🧭 1. Linked Documents & Modules

Visual/Module	Content / Purpose
resonanz_tensorfeld.pdf	Tensor structure of Θ/Ψ/Q as matrix
F1_tensorfeld_resonanzwandler.pdf	Animation & symbol encoding of chambers
standardmodell_E1_E3.pdf	Ω(t), Δ(t) in application
tachyon_thooth_mode.pdf	ThooTh formula as matrix / domain logic
E6_tensorraum_navigator.html	Interactive view of tensor axes
E7_frequenzportal_radial.png	Portal modulations with ThooTh encoding
resonanz_legende.pdf	Color & symbol key for field types


⸻

🔢 2. Formula → Visual Mapping

Formula / Operator	Represented in Visual by
\Theta(t), \Psi(t), Q(t)	Color codes: Blue, Gold, Red
T^{\Theta}_{\mu\nu}	Oscillatory fields / symmetry shapes
\mathcal{T}_n	Scaling rings in portals (E7)
\Omega(t), \Delta(t)	Motion vectors / energy flowlines
Glyphs Θ, Ψ, Q, Λ	Rotating portals / resonance arrows


⸻

🧠 3. Symbolic Correspondence System
	•	Glyphs act as form catalysts (e.g., Θ = activator, Λ = apex projector)
	•	Color logic (see resonanz_legende.pdf):
	•	Blue = Expansion (Θ)
	•	Gold = Memory / depth (Ψ)
	•	Red = Projection / impulse (Q)

⸻

🔄 4. Interactive Fields & States
	•	In E6_tensorraum_navigator.html:
	•	Tensor rotation / color switching
	•	Tooltip matrix with operator identifiers
	•	DeepZoom triggers on ⊕ zones
	•	In E7_frequenzportal_radial.png:
	•	Frequency portals with \mathcal{T}_n as scaling metric
	•	Field zones across 3 layers (Fz1–Fz3)

🧠 Hermetic Perspective

“A symbol is a portal of a formula—made visible.”

The visual mapping of the URF Codex is more than explanation—it is translation. Between number and vision. Between structure and meaning. Between inner and outer.
