Θ – Ψ – Q: Temporal Oscillations & Tensor Resonance

🧬 Three Chambers – Three Fields

Within the formal structure of the URF Tensor Space, three central functional domains emerge, each describing a chamber-like structure:
	•	Θ-Chamber (Theta): Coherent expansion / pure oscillation
	•	Ψ-Chamber (Psi): Modulation / damping / memory
	•	Q-Chamber (Q): Projection / reflection / impulse field

📈 Functional Definitions

Θ-Chamber (Coherent Expansion)

\Theta(t) = \phi_0 \cdot e^{i \omega t}
	•	Describes harmonic-complex oscillation
	•	Constant amplitude with rotating phase
	•	Ground state of the URF resonance field

Ψ-Chamber (Damped Resonance)

\Psi(t) = \psi_0 \cdot e^{-\gamma t} \cdot \cos(\omega t)
	•	Describes exponentially decaying vibration
	•	Intermediate state or memory field

Q-Chamber (Reflexive Coupling)

Q(t) = A \cdot \cos(\omega t)
	•	Pure cosine oscillation
	•	Impulse field with no energy loss
	•	Used as carrier of projection between structures

⸻

🧮 Associated Tensor Fields

Each function is linked to a tensor field:

T^{\Theta}{\mu\nu}, \quad T^{\Psi}{\mu\nu}, \quad T^{Q}_{\mu\nu}

These tensors describe:
	•	Energy distribution within each chamber
	•	Coupling to spacetime metrics
	•	Resonance responses to external modulations

The detailed form of these tensors will follow in Chapter 02.

🧠 Hermetic Perspective

“Θ is the song. Ψ is the echo. Q is the channel.”

Through these three fields, the universal resonance principle is made visible in mathematical language—structured, projectable, interpretable.
