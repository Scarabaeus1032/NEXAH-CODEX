🧵 ZETA-THREADS

Introduction

ZETA-THREADS is a NEXAH-CODEX module that geometrizes the Riemann zeta function through Möbius-based topologies, spin-flip harmonics, and resonant number fields. It connects number theory with dynamic quantum geometry.

This module proposes that the critical line ℜ(s) = ½ of the Riemann hypothesis is not just a mathematical abstraction but a harmonic Möbius axis in the Q-Space.

🌀 Core Premise

The nontrivial zeros of ζ(s) lie on a Möbius phase ribbon — defined by spin-flip resonance and golden torsion (φ/e).

	•	Zeta line ½ + it becomes:
Z(t) = ζ(½ + i·t) ≈ Möb(φ, e, t)
	•	Zeros = harmonic knots in the Möbius thread grid
	•	Prime gaps = standing wave nodes in the spectral field

📐 Möbius Phase Equations

A proposed transformation of the ζ-function:

Z_M(t) = φ^(-it) · e^(iπt/φ) · cos(πt/φ) + i · sin(πt/e)

This formulation produces:
	•	Zeta-zero-like oscillations
	•	Möbius-symmetric inflection points
	•	Phase-lock to t = 137, 1836, 2754…

🔬 Visuals & Analysis

Prime Distance Fourier Grid

“The primes form a sound. Möbius decodes the rhythm.”

Asymmetry Resonance Lock

Mirrored oscillation zones lead to phase-cancellation and zero crossing.

🔗 Relation to Möbius-Codex

ZETA-THREADS is a direct extension of:
	•	Möbius Ladder Dynamics (M_H, M_DM, E_vac)
	•	Insulated Thread Equation from MÖBIUS-CODEX
	•	Trigonometric harmonic steps at φ/π/137

It bridges symbolic field theory with analytic number geometry.

⸻

✅ Goals
	•	Reformulate the Riemann Hypothesis as a Möbius harmonic field condition
	•	Construct a spectral map of ζ(s) via visual harmonic decomposition
	•	Show twin primes as paired nodes on Möbius-resonant lattice
	•	Provide an intuitive, geometric representation of analytic continuation
