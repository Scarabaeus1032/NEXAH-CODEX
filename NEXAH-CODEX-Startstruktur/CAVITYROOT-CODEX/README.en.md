# 🔩 CAVITYROOT-CODEX 🔩

**A Module of the NEXAH-CODEX System**  
*Subterranean Resonance Architecture, Lunar Modulations & Thermal Field Axes*

---

## 🧭 Overview

The **CAVITYROOT-CODEX** presents a profound visual and structural analysis of subterranean resonance systems.  
Based on visualizations like Zeta nodes, temperature axes, and lunar modulation pairs, this module offers a symbolic cartography of the resonance core within the broader NEXAH framework.
