# 🔩 CAVITYROOT-CODEX 🔩

**A Module of the NEXAH-CODEX System**  
*Subterranean Resonance Architecture, Lunar Modulations & Thermal Field Axes*

---

## 🧭 Overview

The CAVITYROOT-CODEX presents an in-depth visual and structural analysis of subterranean resonance structures. Based on visualizations such as Zeta nodes, temperature axes, and lunar modulation pairs, this module offers a symbolic cartography of the resonance core within the NEXAH system.
