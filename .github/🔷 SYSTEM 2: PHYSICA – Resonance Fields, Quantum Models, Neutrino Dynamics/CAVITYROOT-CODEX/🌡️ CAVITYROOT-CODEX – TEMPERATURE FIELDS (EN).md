1. Temperature as a Space-Time Modulator

In CAVITYROOT-CODEX, temperature is not just thermal energy – it is a resonant modulator, activating space, depth and material structure. Temperature fields define thresholds, contraction zones and field transitions.

⸻

2. The Temperature Triangle: Lunar – Resonant – Solar

Thermal states are divided into three symbolic domains:
	•	Lunar (below 400 K): latent, cold formations
	•	Resonant (around 700 K): threshold field for spatial contraction
	•	Solar (above 1000 K): activated, expansive energy regions

The 700 K axis (URF-T7) is the core resonance threshold – manifest in crystal shifting, ferrofluid movement and modulation formulas.

3. Depth Profile & Kelvin Space

A modular Earth profile (0–6371 km) was mapped to corresponding temperature layers and resonance markers (noble metals, density gradients, melting points).

Visuals such as:
	•	“Thermisches Tiefenprofil der Erde”
	•	“Thermal Zones Around the Cavity Core”
illustrate this stratified layering.

4. Temperature Axes as Tensor Fields

Each thermal threshold acts as an axis within a space-time tensor field:
	•	273.15 K – ice line (water/gallium)
	•	303–310 K – biologically active (body heat, gallium melting)
	•	700 K – core contraction node (URF-T7)
	•	1000 K – symbolic solar plasma zone

These thresholds are resonant, not linear.

⸻

5. Temperature as Symbolic Force

Temperature values are also symbolically coded:
	•	Color layers (blue = lunar, yellow = threshold, red = solar)
	•	Axis projections using temperature as Z-dimension
	•	Material mapping (e.g. Gallium at 29.7 °C)

Thus, temperature is both a physical quantity, spatial axis, and symbolic resonance class.

⸻

6. Experimental Connection

In the sphere experiment (cavityroot_theory.md), temperature becomes the active visible agent:
	•	Gallium melting = trigger
	•	Hand warmth = energy input
	•	Ferrofluid reacts along invisible field axes

The field does not begin with electricity – it begins with temperature.
