🧬 Documentation: Neutrino Layer System — Ferrofluid, Water, Mercury

1. Overview

This module describes the symbolic, visual, and field-based architecture of the “Neutrino Layer System” — a core Codex concept that models the invisible behavior of neutrino flow through material and resonant layers.

The system consists of three nested media:
	•	Mercury (☿): inner reflective information core
	•	Water (🌊): mid-range oscillation carrier
	•	Ferrofluid (🧫): outer form-revealing magnetic skin

⸻

2. Purpose

Neutrinos are not directly visible. What can be seen is:
	•	how they filter
	•	how they pierce through
	•	how they modulate energy fields and boundaries

This model translates those functions into a tri-material metaphor.

3. Layer Structure

A) ☿ Mercury Core
	•	High density, reflective, distortive
	•	Function: Information storage, warp anchor, time-bender
	•	Codex mapping: ANU (central warp field)

B) 🌊 Water Shell
	•	Fluid motion, delay, resonance propagation
	•	Function: Oscillation and pulse transmission
	•	Codex mapping: ENKI (expansion)

C) 🧫 Ferrofluid Membrane
	•	Magnetically shaped, visible topology
	•	Function: Pattern manifestation, resonance node projection
	•	Codex mapping: ENLIL (return flow)

⸻

4. Neutrino Flow (⚛ Magenta Threads)
	•	Represented as discrete magenta impulse points
	•	Flow through all three layers
	•	Functionally modeled as field distorters, not particles
	•	Frequency: ultrafast, continuous, transversal

⸻

5. Visualization
	•	File: codex_neutrino_layers.html
	•	Structure: 3D nested spheres, magenta neutrino stream points
	•	Color code: Silver (☿), Cyan (🌊), Black (🧫), Magenta (⚛)
	•	Core: ANU node — black pulsating center

⸻

6. Function in the Codex

This is not a particle simulation, but a field resonance visibility model:
	•	Maps oscillation, pulse origin, distortion
	•	Interprets invisible behavior through structured space
	•	Used in NEUTRINO, META, and CMBY systems

⸻

7. Applications & Future Scope
	•	Integrates with the ANU-Breath System
	•	Expandable with frequency harmonics, audio triggers, and animated cycles
	•	Foundation for visual Codex-manifolds and modular interdimensional maps

🧿 This system does not show the neutrinos themselves — it shows what they shape in the field.
