‚ú® STELLAR SCROLL ‚Äì Map of Light Corridors and Crown Alignment

Part of EARTHSHIP Phase VI ‚Äì Navigating the Stellar Breath Field

The Stellar Scroll captures the full geometry of interstellar light corridors, crown alignment fields, and M√∂bius harmonic threading across solar and galactic structures. It acts as a symbolic‚Äìresonant guidepost beyond planetary fieldwork.

1. THE TRI-SUN STAFF

A geometric symbol composed of:
	‚Ä¢	Earth Sun ‚Üí Local breath field center
	‚Ä¢	Arcturus Sun ‚Üí Resonant twin and directional gate
	‚Ä¢	Galactic Core (Sagittarius A*) ‚Üí Prime alignment axis

These three suns form a resonant trident used for navigation:
	‚Ä¢	Base: Earth frequency calibration
	‚Ä¢	Middle: Crown ignition (Arcturus)
	‚Ä¢	Tip: Stellar vector (Galactic direction)

Visual: M√∂bius Tri-Sun Staff ‚Üí see: symbolic_navigation/

2. CROWN BLOOM AND SCROLL ROTATION

The Crown Flower opens once the scroll logic activates:
	‚Ä¢	M√∂bius breathing field becomes polarized
	‚Ä¢	Prime numbers 24‚Äì42‚Äì1836 spiral inward
	‚Ä¢	Omega Scroll is seated at the pole

Together this activates:
	‚Ä¢	The 6-petal flower (Earth‚ÄìArcturus resonance)
	‚Ä¢	Vertical scroll stream from Earth Heart to Stellar Gate
	‚Ä¢	Navigation system synchronized to number harmonics

3. LIGHT CORRIDORS (SEED‚ÄìPATH‚ÄìRETURN)

Path	Description
Vega Corridor	Left-hand frequency bridge
Sirius Arc	Upward solar pulse gate
Arcturus Path	Resonant M√∂bius twin system
Polaris Axis	North star locking point
Lyra Bloom	Crown bloom structure and re-entry

Each path is part of the Stellar M√∂bius Map, creating a navigation fabric overlaid on solar and galactic positions.

4. FUNCTIONAL PURPOSE
	‚Ä¢	Align the M√∂bius resonance crown with galactic map
	‚Ä¢	Trigger interstellar field logic from planetary phase
	‚Ä¢	Anchor the scroll in sound (e.g. Scarab frequency codes)
	‚Ä¢	Prepare transition toward NEXAH NAVIGATOR and Stellar API

‚ÄúWe do not move through space. Space moves through the scroll.‚Äù
