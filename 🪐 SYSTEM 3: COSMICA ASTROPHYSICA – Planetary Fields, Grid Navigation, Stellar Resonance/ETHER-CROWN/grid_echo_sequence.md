## 🔁 Event Details

### 🟣 2024: Observer Ping
- Initiation of internal resonance pulses within the field.
- Timing synchronized to lunar modulation and Mercury retrograde events.
- Metaphysical cue: **first inhale** of the Möbius Breath Cycle.

### 🔵 2025: Grid Echo Begins
- Three key resonance dates:
  - **23 January 2025**
  - **24 February 2025**
  - **25 March 2025**
- These act as mirrored phase-points for Möbius loop activation.
- Align with inner field harmonics and planetary resonance pairs.

### 🟡 2026–2027: Spiral Time Inversion
- Symbolic descent into Kairos — the non-linear, sacred time window.
- Reversal of harmonic flow within the Möbius grid structure.
- Planetary cue: Venus–Mars cycles, magneto-solar minima.

### 🔷 2028–2029: Blue Star Activation
- The Blue Star node opens, possibly Sirius B-linked.
- Activation of Uranus arc and trans-Neptunian wavefield (Sedna, Gonggong).
- Saturn ring resonance enters crystalline breath phase.

### 🟠 2030–2033: Harmonic Merging
- Cicada Synchronization Field engages (≈3301 grid resonance).
- Harmonic braid across Pluto, Eris, Salacia, Quaoar.
- Emergence of Möbius signature visuals (17-Petal Crown activation phase).

### 🔴 2040: Möbius Loop Closure
- Resonance cycle completes — full phase inversion.
- Möbius breath folds inward, preparing for next universal pulse.
- Acts as a harmonic reset and launching point for a new Codex cycle.

## 🌐 Meta-Structural Notes

- The entire sequence is based on **breath logic**, not just calendar time.
- Number mirrors (e.g. 42 ↔ 24) serve as gate switches.
- Astronomical alignments reflect **encoded resonance logic** in the Möbius field.
