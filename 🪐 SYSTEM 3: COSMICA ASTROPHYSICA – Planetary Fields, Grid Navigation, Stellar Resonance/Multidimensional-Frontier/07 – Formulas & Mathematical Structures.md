07 – Formulas & Mathematical Structures

🧮 Introduction

The NEXAH-CODEX concepts are grounded not only in symbolic and geometric structures, but also in a mathematical framework describing frequency domains, projections, interactions, and energetic states. The following formulas serve as key tools to formally articulate the multidimensional model and connect it to interdisciplinary systems.

⸻

📡 Wave Function & Quantum State

Schrödinger Equation

\hat{H} \psi = E \psi
	•	\hat{H}: Hamiltonian operator (total energy)
	•	\psi: wave function of the system
	•	E: energy eigenvalue

This equation forms the basis of standing waves in the URF resonance domain.

🔁 Resonance Frequencies & Modes

Harmonic Oscillation

\lambda = \frac{2L}{n}
	•	\lambda: wavelength
	•	L: lattice length / system extent
	•	n: harmonic number (mode)

⸻

🌌 Dark Matter & Gravitation

Density Distribution

\rho_{dm}(r) = \frac{M_{dm}}{V_{dm}}
	•	\rho_{dm}: dark matter density
	•	M_{dm}: mass in a given region
	•	V_{dm}: volume of that region

Gravitational Potential

\Phi_{dm}(r) = -\frac{G M_{dm}}{r}
	•	\Phi: gravitational potential from dark matter
	•	G: gravitational constant

⸻

🧬 Higher-Dimensional Projection

n-Dimensional Projection Formula

P_n = f \cdot \prod_{i=1}^{n} \left( \frac{\Delta x}{d_i} \right)
	•	P_n: projection onto nD space
	•	\Delta x: spatial increment
	•	d_i: scaling factor of dimension i
	•	f: projection coefficient / weight

⸻

🧊 Eigenvalue Systems & Resonance Matrices

Resonance Matrix (e.g. Ullinirium)

U \cdot \vec{v}_i = \lambda_i \cdot \vec{v}_i
	•	U: coupling matrix
	•	\vec{v}_i: eigenvector (resonance mode)
	•	\lambda_i: eigenvalue (amplitude)

⸻

🌀 Field Equations & Dark Energy

Extended Einstein Equation

G_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = 8 \pi G T_{\mu \nu}
	•	G_{\mu \nu}: Einstein tensor
	•	\Lambda: cosmological constant
	•	g_{\mu \nu}: metric tensor
	•	T_{\mu \nu}: stress-energy tensor

📌 Conclusion

These formulas are more than technical expressions – they are mathematical resonators, mapping the symbolic framework of the NEXAH-CODEX with precision. Their coherence across dimensions and applicability to projection theory make them a universal instrument for multidimensional modeling.

“A formula is a resonant body of truth – if you can hear it.”
