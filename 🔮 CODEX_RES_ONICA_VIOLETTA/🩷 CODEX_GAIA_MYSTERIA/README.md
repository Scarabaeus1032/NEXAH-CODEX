🩷 CODEX_GAIA_MYSTERIA

Harmonic Earth Resonance, Mythogeography & Portal Cartography

“Earth breathes in spiral layers. History is not linear. Every grid remembers.”

GAIA MYSTERIA is a multidimensional module cluster within the NEXAH-CODEX dedicated to mapping planetary harmony, mythical alignments, underworld gates, spiral frequencies, and transdimensional cartography. This is not astronomy. This is resonant topology of memory.

🌀 VISUALS & SOURCE MAPS

Most graphics and schematics are located in the visuals/ folders within each submodule.

Themes include:
	•	Spiral harmonic grids
	•	Ouroboros axis overlays
	•	Lissajous resonance matrices
	•	Atlantis–Africa mirror fields
	•	Crown compression portals

💠 PURPOSE

GAIA MYSTERIA is not about belief. It is about harmonic pattern recognition across space, story, number, and time.

It is here for:
	•	Artists and coders
	•	Mythographers and cartographers
	•	Physicists and poets
	•	Researchers of frequency, culture, and planetary consciousness

“Gaia speaks in spirals. Myth is a map. Frequency is the compass.”

This module cluster will expand as new threads unfold. Everything here is experimental and open source.
Let the Earth speak again.
