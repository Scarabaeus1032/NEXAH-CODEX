## ðŸ“– Purpose

This document collects and explains symbolic glyphs and harmonic anchors that arise in the context of Hodge-theoretic decomposition. Each glyph encodes a frequency-fixed reference within the algebraicâ€“differential duality space of the NEXAH-CODEX.

The goal is to create a bridge between:

* The *algebraic geometry* of Hodge structures
* The *harmonic field anchors* in the resonance framework
* The *symbolic navigation* using Codex glyph syntax (e.g. Q, Î˜, Î›, á¹ª)

> "Every glyph is a stabilizer: a frozen wave across logic, form and memory."

## ðŸ§¬ Glyphs and Meanings

| Glyph         | Symbolic Function        | Harmonic Role                                             | Example Field Anchor                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Î¦ (Phi)**   | Holomorphic phase anchor | Encodes phase-preserving rotation in (p,p)-space          | Complex orientation on K3 surface      |
| **Î© (Omega)** | Holomorphic 2-form       | Denotes full (2,0)+(0,2) envelope                         | Calabiâ€“Yau threefold cycles            |
| **Q**         | Quantum layer pointer    | Indexes resonant dimensional channels                     | URF-Q axis in Glyph Lattice            |
| **Î˜ (Theta)** | Temporal glyph           | Tracks oscillatory decay / stabilization                  | Collapse period marker in UTS          |
| **á¹¬**        | Torsion glyph            | Highlights structural deformation over non-trivial cycles | Shift of anchor point in divisor twist |
| **V/Î»/á¹ª**     | Codex vector anchors     | Mark directionality in field tensor projection            | Resonance basis vectors                |

## ðŸ”‚ Hodgeâ€“Codex Alignment Map

This symbolic table links classical Hodge decomposition with Codex field syntax:

| Hodge Component    | Codex Symbol | Role                        |
| ------------------ | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| \$H^{2,0}\$        | Î©            | Holomorphic peak carrier    |
| \$H^{1,1}\$        | Î¦, Q         | Real-frequency stabilizer   |
| \$H^{0,2}\$        | Î© (conj.)    | Mirror conjugate            |
| \$(p,p)\$-Diagonal | Î˜, á¹¬        | Temporal + topological lock |

Each of these is embedded in a *harmonic frequency space*, with symbolic resonance paths linking cohomological forms to global stabilizer nodes.

## ðŸ“˜ Examples in Visuals

See `visuals/hodge_surface_twist.png` and `visuals/resonance_field_decomposition.png`:

* Color-coded forms map to glyph overlays
* Scalar nodes (Î¦) mark (1,1)-anchors
* Î© indicates the full complex oscillation range
* Î¦ and Î˜ glyphs serve as phase and collapse regulators

---

## ðŸ”— Contextual Pointers

* Builds on `hodge_uts_interface.md`
* Glyph sets overlap with `Rosetta-Nexus` syntax
* Uses resonance structure from `URF-CODEX/symbolic-axis.md`
* See also `universal_collapse_theorem.md` for symbolic transfer of harmonic stability
