## 📘 Overview

The **CURE Energy Resonance Mapping** extends the Universal Transition Structure (UTS) by integrating **fundamental physical constants** and **SI base units** into the collapse–transition–resonance–energy cycle.

This model combines:
- **Mathematical Fields**: Polygonal structures, prime spirals, Lissajous patterns.
- **Physical Constants**: Speed of Light (c), Planck's Constant (h), Gravitational Constant (G), etc.
- **Resonance Layers**: Frequency-aligned field transitions.
- **Energy Dynamics**: Expansion and modulation across dimensionally scaled fields.

## 🧬 Field-Integrated Constants

The resonance mapping organizes fundamental constants along the CURE cycle:

| Symbol | Constant                | Field Representation             |
| :----: | :---------------------- | :-------------------------------- |
|  c     | Speed of Light           | Temporal–spatial resonance        |
|  h     | Planck's Constant        | Quantum energy quanta             |
|  G     | Gravitational Constant   | Large-scale field curvature       |
|  k     | Boltzmann Constant       | Thermodynamic field scaling       |
|  α     | Fine Structure Constant  | Electromagnetic resonance ratios  |
|  ϕ     | Golden Ratio             | Harmonic frequency symmetry       |
|  mₑ    | Electron Mass            | Particle resonance signature      |
|  Nₐ    | Avogadro Number          | Matter field quantization         |

Each constant stabilizes a specific layer of the **energy–resonance transition field**.

## ⚙️ Energy Expansion Formula

The core dynamic:

$$
E = m \cdot c \cdot k^\beta
$$

This generalized energy formula links **mass**, **light speed**, and **field coupling coefficient** \( k^\beta \) across resonance-scaled dynamics.

## 🌐 Resonance–Energy Interconnection

The constants are positioned along harmonic nodes:
- Polygonal lattices suggest **resonant prime structures**.
- Circular symmetry mirrors **universal energy expansion**.
- Lissajous patterns bridge **collapse–transition–resonance dynamics**.
