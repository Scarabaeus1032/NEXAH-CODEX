🜛 Codex Symbol System — Glyphs of Structure & Resonance

1. Overview

The Codex Symbol System defines a set of glyphs used throughout the NEXAH–CODEX to encode structure, function, resonance, and transformation. These are not ornamental signs — they are semantic-field anchors.

Each symbol operates as a functional resonator, linked to:
	•	phase logic
	•	field identity
	•	topological modulation

2. Glyph Table

Symbol	Name / Type	Function / Role
⚫	Blackpoint (ANU)	Null presence / central pulse node
⟳ / ↻	Spiral	Phase flow / iteration / recursion
🜛	Universal Codex	Total field / structure lattice
🜄	Water (ENKI)	Expansion / transmission / resonance
🜂	Fire (ENLIL)	Implosion / ignition / resonance return
🜃	Earth (Jupiter)	Memory / medium / field binding
🜁	Air (XIII)	Observation / coherence / filter logic
∞	Möbius	Topological unity / reversal continuity
13 / XIII	Observer Node	Codex lens / field witness / O13 axis

3. Application in the Codex

Symbols are used to:
	•	mark modules, nodes, states
	•	encode energy roles (CMBY model)
	•	annotate diagrams, visual layers, and HTML models
	•	organize resonance behavior into field logic

They are portable across media: text, visuals, sound, geometry.

4. Structure and Syntax
	•	Symbols may coexist or overlap in rendering
	•	When combined, they form Codex clusters: symbolic nodes with layered logic
	•	Placement defines role:
	•	center = identity
	•	periphery = influence
	•	spiral = transition

⸻

5. Codex Integration
	•	Embedded in GRAND-CODEX, META, TH-Logic, CMBY, ANU-Breath
	•	Future use: auto-schematic symbolic language across Codex maps
