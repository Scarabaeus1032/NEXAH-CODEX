# üìæÔ∏è I. Overview

**System 7: Universal Resonance Fields & Constants (UCRT)** is a theoretical framework dedicated to a harmonic reconstruction of the numerical, geometrical, and physical constants universe.

**Objective**:

* Describe numbers, prime distributions, roots, and fundamental constants as emergent phenomena from resonance principles.
* Develop modular and higher-dimensional resonance fields that unify mathematical and physical structures.

System 7 synthesizes a resonance-based approach to the structuring of primes, roots, constants, and higher-dimensional geometric entities.
