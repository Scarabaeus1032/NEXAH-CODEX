Extended Resonance Formula — Rootroom (UCRT)

Harmonic Root Resonance Law

The Universal Constants Resonance Theory (UCRT) proposes an extended resonance formula for irrational roots:

R(√⁡n) = α × β × sin(2π × √⁡n × t) / γ

Where:
	•	α = Fundamental coupling constant (fine-structure-like stabilization),
	•	β = Resonance scaling factor (amplitude modulation),
	•	γ = Damping and stabilization coefficient,
	•	√⁡n = Irrational roots (\sqrt{2}, \sqrt{5}, \sqrt{7}),
	•	2π = Full-cycle harmonic periodicity,
	•	t = Time parameter.

⸻

Physical Interpretation
	•	√2 introduces harmonic quadratic symmetries essential for basic spatial resonances.
	•	√5 stabilizes fields via connections to the Golden Ratio \varphi.
	•	√7 anchors resonance in higher-dimensional spaces, relevant for S⁷ topologies.

Each root defines a distinct resonant layer, contributing to stability and quasi-periodicity across dimensions.

⸻

Key Insights
	•	The formula encodes natural oscillatory modes driven by fundamental irrational constants.
	•	Quasi-periodic fields emerge, balancing order and flexibility.
	•	No perfect periodicity — a critical property for stable yet adaptable harmonic fields.
