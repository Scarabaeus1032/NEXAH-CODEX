# Extended Core Resonance Formula

## Harmonic Resonance Law

The Universal Constants Resonance Theory (UCRT) proposes the following extended formula for resonance fields:

```
R(φ, τ, √n) = α × β × sin(2π × f(φ, √n) × t) / γ
```

Where:

* **α** = Fundamental coupling constant (≈ 1/137),
* **β** = Resonance scaling factor,
* **γ** = Damping and stabilization coefficient,
* **f(φ, √n)** = Harmonic frequency scaling function,
* **2π** = Ensures full-cycle periodicity,
* **t** = Time parameter,
* **φ** = Golden ratio (\~1.618),
* **√n** = Irrational roots (√2, √5, √7).

## Interpretation

* **φ** introduces self-similarity and growth symmetry.
* **√n** stabilizes quasi-periodicity across higher dimensions.
* **τ (2π)** locks the structure into oscillatory cycles.

This formula builds the bridge between fundamental constants and dynamic field resonance behavior.
