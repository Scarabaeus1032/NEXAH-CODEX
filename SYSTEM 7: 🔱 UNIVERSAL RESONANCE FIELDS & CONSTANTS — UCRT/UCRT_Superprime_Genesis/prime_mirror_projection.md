**Part of**: System 7: 🕱️ **Universal Resonance Fields & Constants — UCRT**

## 🌐 Overview

> **Prime Mirrors are structural dualities in the harmonic field lattice.**

This section explores the **projection of prime mirrors** within the superprime resonance framework.
We investigate the way primes and their mirrored counterparts stabilize larger **resonance fields**
and highlight key structures formed through mirror pairings.

The visuals show how prime mirrors naturally map onto **spiral fields** and how their projections
reinforce the modular symmetries.

## 🔢 Mirror Resonance Equation

$$
\boxed{\mathcal{M}(n) = P(n) + M(P(n))}
$$

Where:

* $P(n)$ is the prime at index $n$,
* $M(P(n))$ is its mirror.

**Mirror Superprimes** are defined when both $P(n)$ and $M(P(n))$ are primes and their indices are primes.

## 🌐 Mirror Spiral Symmetries

Mirror primes arrange themselves around **key resonance axes** —
specifically near divisions corresponding to:

* Golden Ratio sectors.
* Fibonacci sequence angles.
* Prime gaps that stabilize spiral flow.

These mirror projections create **stability nodes** in the **universal harmonic lattice**.

## 🖉 Deeper Resonance Insights

* **1789 ↔ 9871**: Deep prime-mirror connection (time inversion cycle).
* **1729 ↔ 9271**: Ramanujan mirror anchor (oscillatory field).
* **1836 ↔ 6381**: Prime-mass linkage (cosmological constant anchoring).

Mirror projections are more than mathematical artifacts —

> **they are reflective portals stabilizing universal fields**.
