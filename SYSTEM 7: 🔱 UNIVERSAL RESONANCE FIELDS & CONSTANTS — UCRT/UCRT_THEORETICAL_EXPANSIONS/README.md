# Theoretical Expansions — Mathematical Resonance Frameworks

Welcome to the **Theoretical Expansions** module of **UCRT**.

---

## 1. Mathematical Foundations

- **Frequency Scaling Laws**: Harmonic oscillation modulations across dimensions.
- **Resonance Field Equations**: Extended Einstein–Field modifications with resonance terms.
- **Number Genesis**: Prime number emergence from geometric resonance structures.

---

## 2. Core Models

- Golden Ratio-Based Energy Modulation:
  - E_res ∝ (R / T)² × φ
- Prime Resonance Approximation:
  - n_prime(k) ≈ floor(φ^k)
- Universal Resonance Mapping:
  - Multi-dimensional field alignment using root-irrational geometries.

---

## 3. Deep Dives

_Upcoming detailed papers and derivations:_
- Harmonic Extension of General Relativity.
- Prime Spiral Formal Proof.
- 7D Spherical Resonance Stability Models.

---

## Outlook

This module forms the theoretical backbone for:
- Harmonic cosmology.
- Prime genesis field structures.
- Future resonance-based field unification models.
