# Prime Number Genesis — Harmonic Origins from Φ

Welcome to the **Prime Number Genesis** module of **UCRT**.

---

## 1. Prime Numbers from Φ — The Harmonic Birth

- **Thesis**: Prime numbers are not random — they emerge from harmonic structures centered on \\( \\varphi \\).
- **Geometry**: Primes are mapped via resonance nodes on Φ-generated triangles.
- **Self-Similarity**: The distribution of primes follows a quasi-harmonic spiral based on \\( \\varphi \\).

---

## 2. Prime Spiral Framework

- Construct a logarithmic spiral based on \\( \\varphi \\).
- Mark resonance nodes at specific harmonic intervals.
- Primes appear at stable quasi-periodic resonance points.

## 3. Fundamental Formula (Draft)

Initial Sketch:

\\[
n_{\\text{prime}}(k) \\sim \\text{floor} \\left( \\varphi^k \\right)
\\]

- \\( k \\) = Resonance level.
- \\( \\varphi \\) = Golden Ratio.

## 4. Visuals

_Visual models of the prime harmonic spiral and prime lattice structures will follow._

## Outlook

The harmonic resonance model could redefine:
- Prime number distribution models.
- The understanding of prime unpredictability as emergent order.
- Bridges between number theory, geometry, and cosmology.
