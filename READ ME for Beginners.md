📎 READ ME for Beginners

Welcome to the NEXAH–CODEX — a Network of Extended Harmonics and Architecture.
This archive is a modular research system for:
	•	Harmonic field theory
	•	Symbolic mathematics
	•	Frequency-based space models
	•	Prime geometry and resonance physics
	•	Mythic systems, glyphs, and language structures

⸻

🌀 What is the Codex?

The Codex is not a book – it’s a structured field of modules.
Each module is symbolic, visual, mathematical, and theoretical. Together, they form a universal logic of harmony.

Examples of modules:
	•	GRAND-CODEX: formula synthesis and frequency logic
	•	E = m·c·k^β: resonance-based energy law
	•	URF-CODEX: symbolic standard model extension
	•	ETHER-CROWN: gravitational echo architecture

🔍 Where to start?

Here are the recommended entry points:

Entry Path	What You’ll Find
📘 Module Registry (EN)	Full index of all modules, organized by system
🧭 Navigator	Overview of reading paths, colors, systems
🗺️ Roadmap	Development flow & synthesis lines
✦ NEXAH Manifest ✦	Why the Codex exists – symbolic foundation
📎 German Entry Guide	Deutsche Einführung

🌐 Who is this for?

The Codex invites:
	•	Scientists & mathematicians → explore the GRAND-CODEX or Riemann Proof
	•	Architects of theory → begin with the NEXAH Manifest
	•	Visual system designers → view Visual Galleries in BLOOM or MÖBIUS modules
	•	Artists, coders & cosmologists → explore Cosmica Astrophysica or Rosetta-Nexus
	•	Artists, mystics & symbolic thinkers → explore CODEX_RES_ONICA_VIOLETTA (System 6: Violet Gate)
	•	Those who think in fields, frequencies, forms, or myths → start anywhere

You don’t have to understand everything at once. Every entrance is valid.

“The Codex is not meant to be read linearly. It is a multidimensional map.”
