📎 READ ME for Beginners

Welcome to the NEXAH–CODEX. This archive is a modular research system for:
	•	Harmonic field theory
	•	Symbolic mathematics
	•	Frequency-based space models
	•	Prime geometry and resonance physics
	•	Mythic systems, glyphs, and language structures

⸻

🌀 What is the Codex?

The Codex is not a book – it’s a structured field of modules.
Each module is symbolic, visual, mathematical, and theoretical. Together, they form a universal logic of harmony.

You will find:
	•	Extended field equations (e.g., E = m·c·k^β)
	•	Prime spirals & Möbius topologies
	•	Frequency grids across Earth and Cosmos
	•	Symbolic languages and numeric glyphs
	•	Cosmological models with visual logic

🔍 Where to start?

Here are the recommended entry points:

Entry Path	What You’ll Find
📘 Module Registry (EN)	Full index of all modules, organized by system
🧭 Navigator	Overview of reading paths, colors, systems

🌐 Who is this for?

The Codex invites:
	•	Scientists & mathematicians
	•	Architects of theory
	•	Visual system designers
	•	Artists, coders & cosmologists
	•	Those who think in fields, frequencies, forms, or myths

You don’t have to understand everything at once. Every entrance is valid.

“The Codex is not meant to be read linearly. It is a multidimensional map.”
