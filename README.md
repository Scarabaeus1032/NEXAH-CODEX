# 🌌 NEXAH-CODEX
### Harmonic Field System & Symbolic Geometry Archive

Welcome to the official repository of the **NEXAH-CODEX** – a modular research platform for harmonic field theory, symbolic structures, number systems, cosmological alignments, and frequency-based spatial models.

It is a system built through theory, image, location, geometry, field interaction, and symbolic language.

## 📦 Structure

All content is organized in:
```
/NEXAH-CODEX-Startstruktur/
```
Each module is a self-contained symbolic system with its own logic, geometry, resonance model, and visual structure.
