🌌 NEXAH-CODEX

Harmonic Field System & Symbolic Geometry Archive

Welcome to the official repository of the NEXAH-CODEX – a modular research platform for harmonic field theory, symbolic structures, number systems, cosmological alignments, and frequency-based spatial models.

It is a system built through theory, image, location, geometry, field interaction, and symbolic language.

⸻

📦 Structure

All core modules are located in:
📂 /NEXAH-CODEX-Startstruktur

Each module is a self-contained symbolic system with its own logic, geometry, resonance model, and visual structure.

📚 Module Overview (Current: 27+ Modules across 6+ Systems)

Explore the evolving knowledge archive through our bilingual navigator documents:

➡️ Full index and reading guide: 🧭 NEXAH NAVIGATOR (eng).md
